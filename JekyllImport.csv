Shopping for a 350z,shopping-for-a-350z,"<p>So the 2010 Autocross season is starting up soon, and here in Colorado the winter series is running strong. I had a little incident with the <a href=""http://www.projectquattro.com"" target=""_blank"">projectquattro</a> a few weeks ago, which also has spurred along the motivation to get a 350z.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been monitoring Craigslist here locally for a while now, and it appears that there is a wide variety of 350zs available here around Denver right now. We went north about an hour this afternoon to check out one in particular. <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/sets/72157623108242515/"" target=""_blank"">Check out the photos that I took of the car</a>.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a 2004 Enthusiast model, with an Injen SES Exhaust, a Nismo short shifter, 18&rdquo; wheels off a Performance model and a few other mods. Because it was Sunday we didn&rsquo;t get to look in the car, except through the windows, or under the hood. I&rsquo;m hoping to possibly drive back up there one evening this week to take a look and test drive of the car. </p>

<p>To speed up the purchasing process I&rsquo;m hoping to get rid of the 240z soon, if you&rsquo;re interested in a <a href=""http://www.project240z.com/"" target=""_blank"">1973 Datsun 240z check out the site</a>!</p>

<p>Woot!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m back in autocross mode with a 2004 Nissan 350Z Enthusiast, and here she is.</p>

<p>You might think, hey, wait a minute, isn&rsquo;t that the same car you had back when? Well, not quite. My previous 350z was a 2003 Enthusiast. What&rsquo;s the difference? Well between 2k3 and 2k4, not much, 2k4 I believe is less buggy, the only physical difference i know of is that the 2004 has pads next to your leg on the center console, and a power plug under the passenger side of the dashboard. </p>

<p>Now, the differences between my old 2003 and my new 2004, here they are (differences as of time of purchase of the 2004, and time of sale of the 2003).</p>  <table border=""0"" cellspacing=""0"" cellpadding=""2"" width=""783"">      <tbody>          <tr>              <td valign=""top"" style=""width: 339px;""><strong>2003</strong></td>              <td valign=""top"" style=""width: 442px;""><strong>2004</strong></td>          </tr>          <tr>              <td valign=""top"" style=""width: 339px;"">              <ul>                  <li>Koni Double Adjustable Shocks </li>                  <li>Custom Swaybar </li>                  <li>17&rdquo; OEM Wheels </li>                  <li>NISMO X-pipe </li>                  <li>Custom trailer hitch </li>              </ul>              </td>              <td valign=""top"" style=""width: 442px;"">              <ul>                  <li>18&rdquo; OEM Wheels from a Performance Model </li>                  <li>Injen Super SES Exhaust </li>                  <li>Pioneer Stereo, custom subwoofers and amplifier </li>                  <li>Unknown carbon fiber front splitter </li>                  <li>Unknown carbon fiber rear spoiler </li>                  <li>Carbon fiber accents in Engine bay </li>              </ul>              </td>          </tr>      </tbody>  </table>  <p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>So what comes next? Well, more modifications to get the car ready for the STR Street Touring Roadster class in the SCCA. When I&rsquo;ll get to all those I&rsquo;m not sure. I&rsquo;m going to try to go over the car thoroughly tomorrow in the garage, see if there are any other custom parts I don&rsquo;t know about. At some point in the coming weeks I&rsquo;ll come up with a list of things I need to get done to the car before the full blown autocross season starts up.</p>

<p>Also tomorrow I&rsquo;ve got a guy coming to take a look at the <a href=""http://www.project240z.com"" target=""_blank"">Project240z</a>. I would like to keep that, but I know I shouldn&rsquo;t, I won&rsquo;t ever get it finished, especially now that I have this 350z! </p>

<p>On January 30th I&rsquo;m going to take the <a href=""http://www.project350z.com/"" target=""_blank"">Project350z</a> out to its first Autocross.</p>",2010-01-23 01:20:49.000,html,,,/Blog/itemId/461/And-so-it-begins-Project350zcom-now-has-a-projec
Prepping a 350z for STR (SCCA Autocross),prepping-a-350z-for-str-scca-autocross,"<p>My initial intentions with this new (to me) 350z is to run in the newly formed STR class. This is a street tire class, meaning 140 treadwear or greater, which differs from the Stock Classes, which technically run &ldquo;street legal&rdquo; tires, but are often treadwear 50 or less. </p>

<p>STR also allows for a number of other modifications, over time I&rsquo;m going to be slowly prepping the car for the class, hopefully finalizing everything by the end of the autocross year, in time for Nationals in Lincoln, Nebraska.</p>

<p>As I blog about the prep work for the car I&rsquo;ll <a href=""http://www.project350z.com/Articles/tags/STR.aspx"" target=""_blank"">tag the posts with &ldquo;STR&rdquo;</a>&nbsp;</p>

I&rsquo;ll start blogging over the next few months about the some of the aspects of that post, and what I decide with the various parts and setup for the car.<br />  <br />  <strong>UPDATE: I am not longer building for STR, I am now building for BSP</strong></p>",2010-01-23 21:59:33.000,html,,,/Blog/itemId/462/Prepping-a-350z-for-STR-SCCA-Autocross
Wheels for a 350z in STR,wheels-for-a-350z-in-str,"<p>So I’m slowly starting to figure out what I need to do to get the car ready for the 2010 Autocross season. I’ve been looking around, reading the 2010 SCCA Solo rules, covering the details of the class. I’ve got some more research to do, but for now I’m starting to figure out which wheels I am going to run on the car.</p>

<p>I’ll be running in a street tire class, limited in the treadwear rating and size (width). Tire choice will be left up to another blog post all together. I’m not making a sure decision on wheels just yet, but here’s what I am currently thinking.</p>

<p>When I ran my 2003 350z in BStock I ran a 17” Enkei RPF1 wheels, (<a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/1282982714/in/set-72157601780037044/"" target=""_blank"">here’s a photo</a>). I was limited back then in that I had to run the same size wheels as came from the factory, in STR I won’t be limited to that requirement, but there is a limit as to the max width allowed in the class, 9”. I was thinking I would likely try to get 17” wheels again, but this time in the 9” width, today however Nick put it in my head that I should look at 18” wheels.</p>

<p>the downfall of 18” wheels would be that they are likely going to be heavier than the same wheel in a 17”, but the benefit might be that they would have a taller tire/wheel combo, potentially helping to put more power down. The 350z likely, even in somewhat stock form, won’t have too little power, probably the most power in the class.</p>

<p>If I do decide to go with 18” wheels, that’ll unfortunately cost more from a tire perspective, and also more for the&#160; wheels, but the advantages may outweigh the disadvantages. I don’t know if I’ll be able to find the proper size (18”x9”) in the Enkei RPF1s, though I wouldn’t mind those wheels again. They are nice and light weight, which is definitely something I need to be concerned with in the heavy 350z.</p>

<p>I’m not going to be buying for a couple weeks, if that soon, but I’m definitely going to spend some more time looking at wheel options.</p>",2010-01-27 23:45:20.000,html,,,/Blog/itemId/464/Wheels-for-a-350z-in-STR
"Dropping Weight in the 350z, for STR (now BSP)",dropping-weight-in-the-350z-for-str-now-bsp,"<p>This blog post will be gradually updated over time as I figure out how to drop weight in the 350z prepping it for <s>STR in 2010</s> BSP for 2011.</p>

<p>My 2003 350Z weighed in at 3075lbs in race trim, which included the 17&rdquo; Enkei RPF1s, as little fuel as possible, and all the loose items in the rear of the car removed (carpet, spare tire, tools). I also had the stock exhaust removed, and a NISMO Y-Pipe. The car was a 2003 Enthusiast with only front airbags, aluminum door sills, and splash guards. My new car is a 2004 Enthusiast, with aluminum door sills, no splash guards, front airbags only, and a few other custom mods I will document later. I have a feeling it weighs quite a bit more than my 03 did, but I&rsquo;m hoping to get it down under 3k pounds if possible.</p>

Always good after a wash and a wax,always-good-after-a-wash-and-a-wax,"<p>It has been quite a while, over a year, since I really spent some time washing a waxing a vehicle. My how time has flown, last year we spent time prepping for, and moving to Colorado, during that time I was without a &ldquo;fun&rdquo; car, having sold the <a href=""http://www.corvettez06.org"">Corvette</a> back in October 2008.</p>

<p>Today, for the first time since likely 1995 I spent time washing and waxing a car in California. And the weather was beautiful! I spent the yesterday evening and today up at a friend&rsquo;s house in Fairfield, the town I went to high school in. We had dinner with friends from HS last night, and then this morning I spent the day cleaning up my the 350z for the first time since picking it up, and boy did it need it, especially after the 1200 mile road trip (on the back of an open trailer last week from Colorado to California).</p>

<p>I washed the car, clay barred the various marks and such in the paint, washed it again, and then waxed the car. It looks mucho better now, if I do say so for myself. Here are some pictures of the beauty after her bath.</p>

<p>The rest of the afternoon I hung out and had a BBQ with friends, and new friends. I had a great time, but had to head back down here to San Mateo so I can work tomorrow. I made the drive in 1hr and 10 minutes. If only traffic were that nice all the time I might consider buying a house in my old stomping grounds and commuting to work. But I can only imagine that most days that would be a 2+ hr drive during commute times. Some day, perhaps later this week, I&rsquo;ll get around to blogging about the Project350z&rsquo;s first autocross which happened a few weeks ago.</p>",2010-03-08 01:24:46.000,html,,,/Blog/itemId/468/Always-good-after-a-wash-and-a-wax

"On the road again, temporary tag for smog",on-the-road-again-temporary-tag-for-smog,"<p>So this weekend while my beautiful wife was in town (haven’t seen her for three weeks!) I rented a car for the weekend? Why? Well, to be honest, the 350z wasn’t legal to be driving around on the roads of California! The temporary tags expired on the 1st, and I had planned to hit the DMV up on the 2nd, only to figure out that California had state employees on furlough so the DMV is closed the first three Fridays in April. Welcome to California!</p>

<p>So I rented a car for the weekend, a Mid-sized from National (via Hotwire) and we picked out a black New Beetle. It wasn’t a half bad ride for the weekend, the windshield felt like it was 10 miles away, and I would hate to try to sit in the back seat, but for the two of us it worked out fine.</p>

<p>Over the weekend I tried to figure out what I was going to do with the 350z, I need to get some OEM Cats (catalytic converters) to put back on the car as it came with non-oem ones when I purchased it from the dealer in Colorado. (quick tip: if you buy a car in Colorado, you have three days to have a smog test, if it fails you can take it back to the dealer, I learned this far too late)</p>

<p>I found a few options for getting some OEM Cats and even found a shop locally that will put them on for me saving me the hassle of doing it myself. Normally this wouldn’t be a big deal, but as we haven’t moved all of our stuff from Colorado yet I don’t exactly have a jack and stands to get under the car to do the swap myself.</p>

<p>I’m hoping that cats are all I need to get the car to pass emissions, having purchased the car previously modded (Stevinson Lexus of Frederick in Colorado so far has been unresponsive in my inquiries about why they would sell a car that wouldn’t pass smog), I don’t know exactly what has been done to the car beyond what I can see. We will see if Cats make it legal for California or not. If not I’m likely going to be up a creek!</p>

<p>Monday morning I headed off to the DMV, arriving there at 7:10am, with 5 other cars already in the parking lot. Around 7:25am we started lining up out front to wait for the doors to open at 8am. I was third in line. About 15 minutes or so before 8am an employee from the DMV came out and handed out Window numbers for the first people in line, telling you which window to go directly to when the doors opened up. You know there’s way too much F’n demand and not enough supply when a DMV office has to do this. I wasn’t in there too long, it was actually very painless for me. When I left though the line was backed up out there door, had to be at least 75 people waiting to get in, not to mention all the people already in side and waiting.</p>

<p>I was able to get a two month temp tag from the state for the 350z, so now I’m somewhat legal to drive around as I work to get the car to pass smog. Hopefully I can get that done here in the next couple of weeks. </p>

<p>Sunday I’m going to the <a href=""http://www.zcargarage.com/"" target=""_blank"">Z Car Garage</a> for a ZONC (Z cars of Northern California) dyno day. I’m curious to see what numbers the car puts down in it’s current form and then want to get it dyno’d again after swapping the Cats to see if there’s a big difference. I’ll take plenty of pictures down there, I’m looking forward to meeting some other Z guys this weekend.</p>",2010-04-06 09:32:07.000,html,,,/Blog/itemId/470/On-the-road-again-temporary-tag-for-smog
Where&rsquo;d the 350z go?,whered-the-350z-go,"<p>So it’s been a while since I’ve done any updates here on Project350z.com, so here’s a quick update.</p>

<p>The car has been doing well the past few months but at this point has been relegated to strictly commuter duty, and it will likely be that way for a while now. Though I do hope to hit an event or two here in the coming months, hopefully on towards the end of June and another 2 or 3 in July.</p>

<p>I’m still trying to get the car ready to pass smog, and am hoping to pick up a stock exhaust for the car tomorrow and get that installed so I can get another smog test this weekend. Before I can install it though I need to make room in the garage! Right now the garage is full of stuff from the move, as is the office. I hope to get the office setup tomorrow and at least room for the car in the garage tomorrow if I can get a hold of the exhaust.</p>

<p>I’ve also been cheating on the 350z a little bit. I put money down on a commuter replacement, by registering during the preregistration period for the Nissan Leaf, I even setup a site for it, no not projectleaf, but <a href=""http://www.leafowner.com"">www.leafowner.com</a>. I don’t intend to get rid of the 350z, but if I do get a Leaf the Z will see far less street usage!</p>

<p>More updates coming soon! I might even video the work tomorrow.</p>",2010-05-31 02:07:15.000,html,,,/Blog/itemId/471/Whered-the-350z-go
Nismo Cold Air Intake for a 350z,nismo-cold-air-intake-for-a-350z,"<p>So when the Project350z was purchased in Colorado back in January it had a Nismo Cold Air Intake on it. Shortly thereafter I moved to California, and guess what? The Nismo isn’t CARB legal, which means it isn’t legal for use in the State of California, so off the intake came.</p>

<p>And there it sat. and sat. and sat some more. Until today, I finally decided to pull it out of the box and put it up on <a href=""http://cgi.ebay.com/ebaymotors/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=150469355328&amp;ssPageName=ADME:L:LCA:MOTORS:1123"" target=""_blank"">Ebay.

Ingen Super SES Exhaust Leak on Nissan 350z,ingen-super-ses-exhaust-leak-on-nissan-350z,"<p>[YouTube:WLbs5h7oXWo]</p>

<p>So I spent the afternoon yesterday trying to repair a leak in the Injen Super SES Exhaust system that was on the 350z when I purchased the car back in January. Sometime in March the exhaust started leaking and it has slowly gotten worse. Normally I would of just scrapped it and put something else on, but with all the life changes (new job, moved to California, trying to sell the house in Colorado, prepping for our first child) we’ve been going through the budget hasn’t allowed for that at this point.</p>

<p>When I was down at Z Car Garage with the car on the lift a few months ago we figured out where the leak was, at the seam of the resonator/muffler in the middle pipe of the exhaust system on the driver’s side. Yesterday I finally took the time to get the car into the garage and up on jack stands. I pulled the middle exhaust pipe out off the driver’s side and it was very apparent where the leak was occurring, on the exit side of the resonator, there was pretty much a ring all the way around the pipe and the muffler where it was separated, the entrance side though looked fine.</p>

<p>So I went to Autozone yesterday to get some exhaust sealer, hoping that I would be able to patch up the leak, and at least provide a temporary fix, to get me through the next few months so I could do something different this winter when I start to prep the car for the 2011 SCCA Autocross season.</p>

<p>With the pipe out of the car I took a Dremel tool to the edges around the crack to try to prep the surface a bit. After that I cleaned up the surface a bit and then applied the sealant to the surface. The directions said to leave the sealant for 4 hours, then heat the surface for 10 to 15 minutes. I went ahead and took this approach, using a heat gun to slowly warm the sealant up. This was the end result.</p>

<p>After work tonight I went to O’Reilly and Kragen Auto Parts to get two new gaskets for the pipe and put everything back in the car. I started the car up and all was well, no leak! I took the car down off the jack stands, we’ll see what the video looks like, but damn lucky I wasn’t under the car when two of the jack stands came down! I seem to have good luck with them….</p>

<p>I took the car for a drive and thought all was well, the exhaust sounded great and I didn’t hear any leaks. When I got home and pulled in the driveway however the leaks were back. I sure wish I hadn’t sold the welder before we left Colorado! I would try my hand at fixing this, though I doubt I’d do well with the stainless steel.</p>

<p>So here we are, back at square one. I’ve emailed Injen, I’m hoping they will come through with an option to possibly just purchase the two middle pipes at a reasonable cost. We’ll see how it goes. My next option is probably to look for a stock (OEM) exhaust on My350z.com from someone local, that may be my best option.</p>

<p>And of course, in honor of Project240z.com, the video is above, I put it together from the work yesterday (After working on cleaning up the garage to make room for the car first). I also created a video of tonight’s work while I installed the pipe back in.</p>

"Our first California Autocross, with video and photos",our-first-california-autocross-with-video-and-photos,"<p>So today was the first time I’ve ever autocrossed in California, and the first time the car has seen an event since our runs at the Colorado event in January. I left San Carlos early in the morning and headed off to pick up <a href=""http://www.willstrohl.com"" target=""_blank"">Will Strohl</a>. We headed down to Marina California for the <a href=""http://www.norcalufo.org/main/"" target=""_blank"">Northern California United Five-Ten Owners Club</a> </p>

<p>We headed south towards Marina, and decided we wanted to try to grab some food, unfortunately we didn’t have much luck finding anything, and ended up going a different way than Google Maps originally said. Though, to be honest, I think we went a better way, we headed down 101 to 156, and bypassed the hills/mountains over towards Santa Cruz. We were there before the gates opened, and when they did we were two of the first people there.</p>

<p>We walked the course as typical at an autocross to get a feel for where you were supposed to drive during the event. I ended up working the first heat, and running the third, so while I was busy working Strohl sat around watching, shot a little video, and texted with his significant other to keep himself entertained.</p>

<p>When it came time to run in the third heat Will helped me get the car ready, and I was <a href=""http://twitpic.com/2sa58u"" target=""_blank"">ready to line up</a>. I went out on my first run by myself, with the plan to see the course completely and try not to make a fool of myself when the second run came up and Will came along for a ride. Here’s the video from my first run, unfortunately I seem to have picked up an old habit from my past autocross days. My first run was my fastest for the day.</p>

<p>Overall the event was just so so for me. It was good to be back and autocrossing, though i was disappointed with my performance. I ran in BSP for the event, or at least I think I did, the event organization was a little different than I am used to having run primarily SCCA events for most of my autocross career. I don’t know what the end results are for the event, everything was done on paper, so I imagine it will be a few days before the results are actually posted.</p>

<p>What I did learn, or remember, is that running the 350z on street tires is not fun! Now I need to figure out what I’m really going to do with this car. We’ve got a kid coming, VERY SOON, so I need to find something that I can drive that is kid friendly, though I hope to not have to get rid of the 350z. I hope to get to autocross again in the next couple months, we will see. </p>

<p>I’m thinking that this car might be fun to play with in SSM, but that might entail a turbo and lots of other toys!</p>

<p>I took a number of photos at the event, here are some of me, and then the <a href=""http://www.project350z.com/Photos/view/setdisplay/setid/72157624917119301.aspx"" target=""_blank"">full Flickr Set</a>.</p>

"Injen Exhaust for a 350z, Still Leaking",injen-exhaust-for-a-350z-still-leaking,"<p>So I still have an exhaust leak in the Injen Super SES System on my 2004 Nissan 350z. And I must say, I’m not too happy about it. <a href=""http://www.project350z.com/Articles/itemId/473/Ingen-Super-SES-Exhaust-Leak-on-Nissan-350z.aspx"" target=""_blank"">I blogged about this over a month ago</a>, almost two months now. I actually emailed Injen at the time, and I got a fairly quick response inquiring about photos of the system so they could try to figure out what replacement parts I need.</p>

<p>Since then there has been radio silence. I emailed them the photos, I’ve emailed them since, and have heard nothing back. At this point in time I’m going to have to suggest, if you’re serious about your ride, stay away from Injen Systems. For cold air intakes, exhaust systems, whatever they sell. If this is the customer service they provide I can’t suggest that anyone ever buys a product from them.</p>

How do you get better at Autocross?,how-do-you-get-better-at-autocross,"<p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/5028275443/"" target=""_blank""><img style=""padding-bottom: 5px; padding-left: 5px; padding-right: 5px; padding-top: 5px"" border=""0"" alt=""Project350z Autocrossing"" align=""right"" src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4091/5028275443_f27b042640_m.jpg"" width=""240"" height=""160"" /></a>This is often a question that people will ask when they first start autocrossing, or in my case, when they resume autocrossing after two years of not competing. Additional questions about autocross include: How do I get better? Do I really suck this bad? Why am I so slow? How do I get faster?</p>

<p>The way you get better at Autocross is by doing it more. I don’t mean by going slower when you are on course so you get more time at each event. The key to getting better is to do it more! Go to more events, run as many as you can afford to enter and are willing to drive to. If you aren’t fortunate enough to live in an area that has a large number of events, I recommend trying to find events outside of your area. They will likely require more time and money commitments, getting to and from the events, but it really is all about the Seat Time!</p>

<p>I am in that boat, I haven’t autocrossed competitively in over 2 years, since I sold the Corvette (<a href=""http://www.corvettez06.org"">www.corvettez06.org</a>), due to a couple of moves across the country, buying (and selling) our first house, and prepping to have our first child (<a href=""http://www.jacquelinehammond.com"">www.jacquelinehammond.com</a>).&#160; </p>

<p>You can also attend autocross schools, I’ve been to those put on by <a href=""http://evoschool.com/"">http://evoschool.com/</a> multiple times, and highly recommend it as an option, though I think you should have a year or so of autocross under your belt before you attend one. Also check your local area for autocross schools put on by clubs, they are a great way to get started, and actually that was how I got into autocross back in 2000, by attending a local autox school in St. Louis.</p>

<p>So how do I plan to get better at autocross? By going to as many events as my budget, life, and wife will let me go to! I’m fortunate that I live in the Bay Area (SF, CA) as there are events here almost every weekend, and in a lot of weekends multiple events going on.</p>",2010-09-30 14:35:12.000,html,,,/Blog/itemId/478/How-do-you-get-better-at-Autocross
The 240z Lives! and it looks great!,the-240z-lives-and-it-looks-great,"<p>So it&rsquo;s been a while since I&rsquo;ve blogged here on Project240z.com, reason being that I sold the car quite a while ago. Back this summer I got an email from a guy telling me he was the new owner, having purchased it from the guy that I sold it to.</p>

<p>Then, a couple weeks ago I got these in my inbox:</p>

<p>I cried a little bit. The car looks great, it has a motor in it, and it even has license plates! </p>

<p>I&rsquo;m glad he sent them to be, but it definitely makes me sad, to see the car up and running, all one color, I had it 4 years and never had it looking that good! Great work, I hope to hear more about the car in the future.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m still debating what is going on with the 350z, one day I want to trade it and get an EVO or STI, other days I want to keep it and put a turbo on it. We&rsquo;ll see, for now I imagine it will stick around because we&rsquo;ve got a lot of other things going on and the budget doesn&rsquo;t necessarily allow for a turbo AWD right now.</p>",2010-11-14 01:51:11.000,html,,,/Blog/itemId/480/The-240z-Lives-and-it-looks-great
"Injen Super SES exhaust removal, OEM 350z exhaust installation",injen-super-ses-exhaust-removal-oem-350z-exhaust-installation,"<p>If you’ve followed my struggles here on Project350z.com you know by now that my 2004 350z came (when I purchased it in January 2010) with an Injen Super SES exhaust system. This system was a true dual exhaust setup from the cats back.</p>

<p>You might also remember I’ve complained a few times about it leaking. Well, I finally gave in. Injen wasn’t helpful in getting me a replacement part to repair the leaking section (at the welds) so I went and purchased an OEM exhaust from a local guy off of My350z.com.</p>

<p>I’ve had the exhaust sitting in my garage for a month or more, and finally got around to making room to get the car in and up on jackstands so that I could take the POS Injen system off the car. In the spirit of all the videos I used to do for Project240z.com (and for all the future videos I plan to do here) I’ve done another time lapse. Here’s the <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uulSUF6BUVk"">YouTube video</a>, you can hear the Injen exhaust as I back in, the car without any exhaust system connected to the cats, and then the OEM exhaust. (the first part of the video is me cleaning up the garage, much needed so I could make room for the car)</p>

<p>[YouTube:uulSUF6BUVk]</p>

<p>I must say, I kind of liked the sound of the car when I fired it up without any exhaust (dumping at the cats), though I’m sure my neighbors didn’t care for it, and I’m 100% positive the police wouldn’t like me driving around like that either. The stock exhaust is far too quiet, but it will have to do for now.</p>

<p>Here in the next few weeks I’ll be putting together a blog post on parts and modifications I need to make to the car for the 2011 autocross season. I’m still not sure what class I will run in yet, either STR, BSP, or maybe even SSM.</p>

<p>I need to see if anyone makes a trailer hitch for a 350z so that I can haul wheels and tires around. I know I had one before, but the guy who made it isn’t making them anymore. I’ll also need to locate another trailer. To be honest, if I was in Missouri I would just call up the buddy who purchased my 03 350z and ask for the hitch and trailer, he’s not using them!</p>

<p>I’ve yet to decide what I’ll do with the Injen system. I may try to sell it, I may take it somewhere for scrap.</p>

<p>Injen, if you’re reading this, I’m still open to putting the SuperSES system back on the car, but I need your help replacing the midpipes to do that! I’m even willing to pay, but I need you guys to respond to basic customer service emails.</p>",2010-12-06 02:52:21.000,html,,,/Blog/itemId/481/Injen-Super-SES-exhaust-removal-OEM-350z-exhaust
Buy a motor to build up?,buy-a-motor-to-build-up,"<p>So I am not sure where the 350z is ultimately headed. I think SSM in SCCA Autocross could be fun, though that will take some time and a lot of money to do.</p>

<p>I was thinking, perhaps a motor build up would be a place to start. And rather than build up a turbo motor from what I currently have, keep it as is and find another motor to build up.</p>

<p>There’s a guy selling one on My350z that is somewhat local, could be an interesting thing to pull into the garage. Though, considering we got rid of the pickup truck last week it might not be a good idea to acquire a new motor just yet <img style=""border-bottom-style: none; border-right-style: none; border-top-style: none; border-left-style: none"" class=""wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-smile"" alt=""Smile"" src=""http://www.project350z.com/Portals/4/PublishThumbnails/Windows-Live-Writer/Buy-a-motor-to-build-up_14372/wlEmoticon-smile_2.png"" /></p>

<p>Back in August I received a response from Injen</p>  <blockquote>  <p>Hi Chris,</p>

<p>Can you send me a picture of your exhaust? I guess we had a few different ones made for that same vehicle and a photo would make it much easier to figure out what part and get you the correct part.</p>

<p><strong><b>Thank You,</b></strong></p>

<p>&#160;</p>  </blockquote>  <p>I responded with photos of the exhaust and what I needed. I have heard nothing back. I’ve emailed them multiple times, even emailing their tech and info email addresses, but so far I have not received a single response from them since that email quoted above.</p>

<p>I sure wish I could get some help, I actually liked the exhaust on my 350z, but this has to be the worst customer service ever!</p>

"Look out, Vinyl Boy is back",look-out-vinyl-boy-is-back,"<p>So it has been over 2 years since I’ve had vinyl on a car, that will be changing in 2011. Look out for the upcoming transformation of the Project 350z! Early in the year I will be doing a minor overhaul, with the goal of doing a full wrap on the car later in the year.</p>

<p>I just need to find someone local who can do the wrap for a reasonable cost, and make sure that they don’t damage the car in the process. I’ve not had anyone apply vinyl to my cars before, I’ve always done it myself, but I don’t have visions of being able to do a full wrap myself. </p>

<p>For a refresher, here are some photos of some of my past vinyl experiences (all self applied)</p>

<p>I finally broke down and bought some Koni Sports for the <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.project350z.com"">Project Z</a>. I say finally but they really have only been stateside for 2 months now, so I didn’t wait all that long to order them. At the end of this write-up you’ll find a summary of my autocross career, to get a better understanding of the author of this piece.</p>

<p><strong>The part numbers are as follows.</strong></p>

<p>8241-1216L Sport Left Front   <br />  8241-1216R Sport Right Front    <br />  8241-1217 Sport Rear (single)</p>

<p><strong>Installation procedures</strong>    <br />  I have the Nissan Service Manual for the 350Z, and would highly recommend purchasing one as they are invaluable when it comes to working on your vehicle. I won’t be using any photos from the manual, as reproducing it on the web would most likely be a little frowned upon by Nissan. I will however try to include pictures with notations on installation procedures.</p>

<p>I would also recommend checking out the article on <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.sportzmagazine.com/"">SportZ</a> Magazine’s latest issue on the Koni install procedure, I received a copy of the article and found it to be very helpful.</p>

<p>To begin the car was placed on our lift and raised off of the ground about 3 feet . We removed all four wheels from the vehicle before we did any other work to make everything easier and to get them out of the way.   <br />  <a target=""_blank"" href=""/portals/4/ProjectZ/KoniInstall/350Z-Koni-Install-6.jpg""><img alt="""" src=""/portals/4/ProjectZ/KoniInstall/th_350Z-Koni-Install-6.jpg"" /></a></p>

<p>The shocks come in two separate boxes, one box for the fronts, and one for the rears.   <br />  <a target=""_blank"" href=""/portals/4/ProjectZ/KoniInstall/350Z-Koni-Install-1.jpg""><img alt="""" src=""/portals/4/ProjectZ/KoniInstall/th_350Z-Koni-Install-1.jpg"" /></a><a target=""_blank"" href=""/portals/4/ProjectZ/KoniInstall/350Z-Koni-Install-7%20rears.jpg""><img alt="""" src=""/portals/4/ProjectZ/KoniInstall/th_350Z-Koni-Install-7.jpg"" /></a><a target=""_blank"" href=""/portals/4/ProjectZ/KoniInstall/350Z-Koni-Install-48.jpg""><img alt="""" src=""/portals/4/ProjectZ/KoniInstall/th_350Z-Koni-Install-48.jpg"" /></a></p>

<p><strong>Rear Shock Install</strong>    <br />  I started with the rear of the car, and it was by far the easiest method to take. The rears each require the removal of 1 bolt, and 2 nuts to remove from the car.</p>

<p><a target=""_blank"" href=""/portals/4/ProjectZ/KoniInstall/350Z-Koni-Install-14.jpg""><img alt="""" src=""/portals/4/ProjectZ/KoniInstall/th_350Z-Koni-Install-14.jpg"" /></a><a target=""_blank"" href=""/portals/4/ProjectZ/KoniInstall/350Z-Koni-Install-16.jpg""><img alt="""" src=""/portals/4/ProjectZ/KoniInstall/th_350Z-Koni-Install-16.jpg"" /></a></p>

<p>Once you have one removed from the car you’ll see the top mount.   <br />  <a target=""_blank"" href=""/portals/4/ProjectZ/KoniInstall/350Z-Koni-Install-17.jpg""><img alt="""" src=""/portals/4/ProjectZ/KoniInstall/th_350Z-Koni-Install-17.jpg"" /></a></p>

<p>I removed this top nut from the shock using an impact gun. It may take a little working with to get it removed without spinning the shaft too much, but if you drive it back on and off a few times it will usually free up. Being that this was a stock shock which would only go back on the car if I sell it, I wasn’t too concerned with spinning the shaft. I do not recommend using a gun to drive the nut back onto the Koni shock, more on that later.</p>

<p>Now to reassemble the rear shocks. I didn’t take a picture of the parts included with the rears but you can sort of see this bag in the picture below (yellow arrow), there is a nut in there for the bottom shock mount, a nut for the shaft, and a what is really just a large metal washer that goes into the upper shock mount.   <br />  <a target=""_blank"" href=""/portals/4/ProjectZ/KoniInstall/350Z-Koni-Install-7.jpg""><img alt="""" src=""/portals/4/ProjectZ/KoniInstall/th_350Z-Koni-Install-7.jpg"" /></a></p>

<p>This is how the stock upper mount comes off of the stock shock (upside down). You’ll want to set aside the metal shield that has a red arrow marked discard on it.. The washer is used to keep the rubber grommet (yellow arrow marked grommet)&#160; from pushing down on the rear shock adjustment mechanism. Please notice the installation order in the picture, you would really hate to get everything installed incorrectly wouldn’t you? (see our front install for an example ?) You’ll notice a little orange ring; to me it appears to be a gasket for the upper mount to the body of the car. I just left this in place throughout the install. Please see the included Koni paperwork, what little there actually is, for the proper torque settings for the nut on the top of the shock. You can tighten down this nut with a wrench, and use a pair of pliers or channel locks to hold the shaft in place, notice the flat sides of the top of the shaft for this.   <br />  <a target=""_blank"" href=""/portals/4/ProjectZ/KoniInstall/350Z-Koni-Install-23.jpg""><img alt="""" src=""/portals/4/ProjectZ/KoniInstall/th_350Z-Koni-Install-23.jpg"" /></a><a target=""_blank"" href=""/portals/4/ProjectZ/KoniInstall/350Z-Koni-Install-24.jpg""><img alt="""" src=""/portals/4/ProjectZ/KoniInstall/th_350Z-Koni-Install-24.jpg"" /></a></p>

<p>When putting the shock back onto the car here is a tip I pulled out of the article in <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.sportzmagazine.com/"">SportZ</a> Magazine. You can compress the shock before you put it back on the car, it will slow rebound it self back into position, but it should give you PLENTY of time to get the shock in place on the car. I would recommend compressing the shock, get it lined up with the lower mount and the upper mount, then put the bolt (from the stock shock) into the bottom mount of the shock with the Koni included nut on the other side of the mount. This will keep the base of the shock in place while you try to get the upper mount installed.</p>

<p>The upper mount may be a little tricky to line up, if the shock doesn’t rebound completely to the top of the fender wheel (to the mounting bolts) you may try raising the rear suspension of the side you are working on with a jack, basically compressing it as though the car where sitting with weight on that corner. This will allow getting the shock into the upper mount properly without to much hassle. Tighten down the bolts on the top mount, see image 16 above. One thing to remember when doing this install, you want the adjustment mechanism of the shock to be easily accessible, so you want it facing out, you should be able to turn it a little when you have the shock back on the car, but it’s best to try to have it facing out to begin with..</p>

<p>Don’t forget to torque down the lower mount as well. The article from <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.sportzmagazine.com/"">SportZ</a> Magazine recommends doing this while the car is setting on the ground, for the front and the rear shocks,&#160; as tightening the lower mounts at this time help to prevent premature wear on the components. That isn’t exactly the easiest thing to do, but I would highly recommend it. If you don’t get the lower bolt/nut tightened well you will get a clunking noise from this lower mount. (ask me how I know).</p>

<p>Repeat this process on the other rear shock for the car. This is what it looks like when finished.   <br />  <a target=""_blank"" href=""/portals/4/ProjectZ/KoniInstall/350Z-Koni-Install-26.jpg""><img alt="""" src=""/portals/4/ProjectZ/KoniInstall/th_350Z-Koni-Install-26.jpg"" /></a></p>

<p><br />  <strong>Front Shock Install</strong>    <br />  The front shock install is requires a bit more work than the rear install did. You will also need a spring compressor of some sort to disassemble the front shock units. I borrowed this tool from a local autozone. Basically the way it works is you pay for the tool and you return it when you are done if you want your money back. This isn’t like the Wal-mart rental policy; this is actually a legit program.<a target=""_blank"" href=""/portals/4/ProjectZ/KoniInstall/350Z-Koni-Install-3.jpg"">     <br />  <img alt="""" src=""/portals/4/ProjectZ/KoniInstall/th_350Z-Koni-Install-3.jpg"" /></a></p>

<p>The FSM tells you to remove the wheel, and then the under cover. I never did figure out what the “under cover” was that it referenced, but I obviously didn’t have to remove it to get the shock out if I couldn’t find it.</p>

<p>(This step differs on cars with TCS and VDC, this step was performed on a car with only TCS) Next you will remove the Wheel sensors from the back of the hub. The wheel sensor has a cable that is marked with the yellow arrows in this image . This image shows what the sensor looks like mounted on the back of the hub. . When removing the wheel sensor be careful, the FSM specifically says not to pull on the wheel sensor.&#160; Pull out the two grommets where the wire is attached to the shock body, and then use a wrench or socket to remove the bolt holding the sensor itself to the hub. Place the sensor up and out of the way, try not to twist the cable too much, when you go to install the sensor again make sure that the white line does not twist upon install. I set the sensor on what I would assume is the “under cover” towards the front of the car to keep it and the cable out of the way while I removed the shock.   <br />  <a target=""_blank"" href=""/portals/4/ProjectZ/KoniInstall/350Z-Koni-Install-52.jpg""><img alt="""" src=""/portals/4/ProjectZ/KoniInstall/th_350Z-Koni-Install-52.jpg"" /></a><a target=""_blank"" href=""/portals/4/ProjectZ/KoniInstall/350Z-Koni-Install-55.jpg""><img alt="""" src=""/portals/4/ProjectZ/KoniInstall/th_350Z-Koni-Install-55.jpg"" /></a><a target=""_blank"" href=""/portals/4/ProjectZ/KoniInstall/350Z-Koni-Install-33.jpg""><img alt="""" src=""/portals/4/ProjectZ/KoniInstall/th_350Z-Koni-Install-33.jpg"" /></a></p>

<p>Next remove the nut that holds the brake hose to the shock absorber . Pull the mount off of the shock and push the brake line aside.   <br />  <a target=""_blank"" href=""/portals/4/ProjectZ/KoniInstall/350Z-Koni-Install-51.jpg""><img alt="""" src=""/portals/4/ProjectZ/KoniInstall/th_350Z-Koni-Install-51.jpg"" /></a></p>

<p>You’ll also need to remove the strut tower bar. To do this you’ll want to fix the center bolt in place and loosen the nut on the left and right side of that center bolt. Once those are lose you’ll want to turn the center top towards the rear of the car 660 degrees, that should place the silver mark of the center bolt above. Remove the 3 bolts and one nut from each of the strut bar mounts and remove the bar from the vehicle.</p>

<p>One thing the FSM doesn’t tell you to do, but the <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.sportzmagazine.com/"">SportZ</a> article recommends is to remove this cotter pin and nut, this will give you some slack when removing the shock and make removal a lot easier. Note: Yours should not be painted, I took mine to a horrible place and they did a horrible job repainting the front end. I also remove the nut from the sway bar link to the transverse bar (no picture).<a target=""_blank"" href=""/portals/4/ProjectZ/KoniInstall/350Z-Koni-Install-32.jpg"">     <br />  <img alt="""" src=""/portals/4/ProjectZ/KoniInstall/th_350Z-Koni-Install-32.jpg"" /></a></p>

<p>Remove the bolt and nut on the lower shock mount, holding the shock to the transverse link. (I don’t seem to have a picture of this either). You may want to leave the bolt in the lower mount to help keep it in place while you perform the next step.</p>

<p>Now you’ll remove the nuts from the upper mount, you should see them exposed by the removal of the strut bar. Remove the bolt from the lower mount and you should now be able to pull the assembly off of the car. If you need to you can put a little pressure on the break disc to push the lower suspension assembly down to give you better access to remove the assembly.</p>

<p><strong>Front Shock disassembly     <br />  </strong><em>(ALWAYS USE CAUTION WHEN WORKING WITH SPRINGS)</em>    <br />  Using the spring compressor from the picture above compress the spring so that it has a little play between the lower spring perch and the upper mount. This will allow you to remove the nut from the top of the shock. I used an impact gun for removal, if it doesn’t come off easily on the first try, drive the nut back down and try removal again, working it in this manner helped me remove the nuts without much trouble. Without an impact gun you’ll need to try to hold the top of the shock in place with locks and turn the nut with a wrench. From past experience, try to use an impact gun for this, or you should spend hours trying to get things apart.</p>

<p>Once you have the nut free remove the upper mount and boot (attached) you can them remove the compressed spring.    <br />  <a target=""_blank"" href=""/portals/4/ProjectZ/KoniInstall/350Z-Koni-Install-45.jpg""><img alt="""" src=""/portals/4/ProjectZ/KoniInstall/th_350Z-Koni-Install-45.jpg"" /></a><a target=""_blank"" href=""/portals/4/ProjectZ/KoniInstall/350Z-Koni-Install-41.jpg""><img alt="""" src=""/portals/4/ProjectZ/KoniInstall/th_350Z-Koni-Install-41.jpg"" /></a></p>

<p>Koni supplies you with these parts, along with a spring perch that goes on the shock body.&#160; The white washer goes on top of the shock body (yellow arrow) and the spring perch sets where the red arrow is pointing. . This is NOT how the spring perch goes, this picture shows the perch in an upside down position. . To see if you have the perch lined up properly put the perch on the new shock and hold the new and old shock side by side, you’ll see if the perches line up. I learned that little trick after I reassembled the right front shock, so I had to redo that side.    <br />  <a target=""_blank"" href=""/portals/4/ProjectZ/KoniInstall/350Z-Koni-Install-50.jpg""><img alt="""" src=""/portals/4/ProjectZ/KoniInstall/th_350Z-Koni-Install-50.jpg"" /></a><a target=""_blank"" href=""/portals/4/ProjectZ/KoniInstall/350Z-Koni-Install-49.jpg""><img alt="""" src=""/portals/4/ProjectZ/KoniInstall/th_350Z-Koni-Install-49.jpg"" /></a><a target=""_blank"" href=""/portals/4/ProjectZ/KoniInstall/350Z-Koni-Install-51.jpg""><img alt="""" src=""/portals/4/ProjectZ/KoniInstall/th_350Z-Koni-Install-51.jpg"" /></a></p>

<p>When holding them up side by side you should be able to line the perch up on the new shock body closely to the way the perch is fixed on the stock body. This allows for the proper placement of the spring, which eases the assembly of the assembly back onto the vehicle.    <br />  <a target=""_blank"" href=""/portals/4/ProjectZ/KoniInstall/350Z-Koni-Install-40.jpg""><img alt="""" src=""/portals/4/ProjectZ/KoniInstall/th_350Z-Koni-Install-40.jpg"" /></a>.</p>

<p>Place the spring back onto the perch, still compressed in the spring compressors, and then put the boot and upper mount back onto the shock. You will at this time need to put the washer and nut included in the picture of parts above back onto the shock. This should be done by hand, not with an impact gun as you don’t want to PreLoad the shock’s rebound settings by twisting the shaft. You should be able to hand twist the nut on, and use a pair of wrenches to get the nut on securely. If you do not get this nut on tight it WILL make noise. It took me a few days of lifting the car up and down trying to figure out where I was getting a knocking from. It ended up being because when I had to redo the right front shock I didn’t get the nut on the shaft of the shock tightened down properly. The proper torque settings are included in the Koni documentation, which I do not have handy at the moment. Once you have the nut tightened down on the shock you’ll need to remove the spring compressors.</p>

<p>Now it’s time to install this assembly back onto the car. I did the install in this manner. Get the top of the shock assembly into the general area of the upper mounting point to that the shaft of the shock is inside the open whole at the top of the mount. Try to get the lower mount into place, feed the included bolt from Koni into the lower mount to hold the assembly in place but don’t tighten it down yet.. From the top of the car you can pull up on the spring to raise the suspension assembly into place to alight the three bolts in the upper strut mount to line up properly with the three wholes in the body of the car. Get at least one of the nuts started so that you can quit pulling up on the spring!</p>

<p><br />  Everything else should be fairly straight forward to reinstall. Be sure to properly torque everything down to the settings in the FSM. When installing the wheel sensors be sure to not twist the cables. I can speak from experience, go over everything, make sure you tighten everything down, the little knocks get rather annoying, and it’s easier to get everything the first time then to have to go back and look for something you missed.</p>

<p>I’ll have to do a write-up on the performance on these shocks next week. From a week and a half of driving, and one autocross event though I will include a few observations.</p>

<p><strong>First Event on Konis</strong>    <br />  I ran a two day divisional less than 48 hours after installing the Koni’s on the Project 350Z. The first day I started with the rear shocks at 3 turns from full soft, and the front at one full turn from full soft. To give you an idea of what settings the shocks have I believe the rears have 12 turns to get to their stiffest rebound setting, and the fronts appear to have 2.5 full turns from soft to firm. Each turn on the rear is probably ¼ of a turn if they were adjusted from the top as the fronts are.</p>

<p>After my 2nd run I decided to try taking out ½ turn from the fronts. This was what I would call a mistake! The car got extremely loose on my 3rd run, which helped to kick the ABS ice-mode on, a problem I had last year at the Topeka ProSolo, and Carter had in his 350Z at Nationals last year. We figure this is caused by the car sensing one wheel is different from the others, probably off the ground when the others are on the ground, so the brakes freak out and don’t want to stop the car. It doesn’t pulse like ABS is kicking in, but the car stops breaking like it should and decelerates at a slower rate. My 99 Camaro had the same problem on the Topeka concrete under extremely hard braking.</p>

<p>For my 4th run I put ¼ turn back into the shocks, this made a pretty good combination, as the car felt more settled than run 3, but still loose enough to work with. On Monday (2nd day) I left the settings the same on the car, and ran a bit closer to the leader in BS for the weekend. I ended up in 3rd for the event, I had been in 4th by .005 or so behind Lee from Oklahoma in a Track model 2004 I believe.</p>

<p>I’m headed to OKC this weekend for the 2nd divisional event, and will report back on my settings when I return! I hope this is helpful to someone else out there in doing their install. If you have any questions, or notice any blatant errors in this please feel free to let me know via the comment section of this blog!</p>

<p><strong>About the Myself (the author)</strong></p>

<p>I’ve been autocrossing since March of 2000. I started out in a 1994 VW Golf III, and competed in that car for about 15 months. I competed in my first National Tour event in Peru Indiana in July, and then the SCCA Solo II Nationals in September. I finished last in both events in the newly formed STS (street touring) class. In July of 2001 I decided I wanted to buy a car that I knew could be competitive with just the minor modifications that were allowed in the stock classing structure of SCCA Solo II. I decided on F-Stock, and started looking for a 4th Generation F-Body (Camaro) that would suite my needs.</p>

<p>I was looking around St. Louis for a few weeks for a LS-1 powered (98+) 6 speed, that wasn’t in Red. I found a 1999 Z-28 in Macon Missouri and picked it up. I immediately purchased a set of Koni Shocks for the car, an extra set of wheels, and some R-compound tires. At the Solo Nationals that year (2001) I still got kicked in the rear, but not near as bad this time! I can’t seem to find the results from that year, but I think I finished something like 47th out of 54. In 2002 I finished 14th in F-Stock out of 35+ entrants. I also finished 3rd in F-Stock at the Topeka ProSolo that April.</p>

<p>In 2003 I decided to change vehicles and purchased my 2003 Nissan 350Z Enthusiast model. I acquired a second set of the stock Enthusiast 17” wheels for a set of R-compound tires. I competed last year at the Peru National Tour, the Topeka ProSolo and the SCCA Solo II Nationals. At Nationals I finished 43rd out of 60 drivers. I was the second fastest 350Z driver, but far behind Carter Thompson who finished 6th. I was also running on Kumhos, even though the 2003 Results say I was on Hoosiers.</p>

<p>Along comes 2004, I kind of lost interest in autocross up through the end of May. I guess I go through a little lull every year, this year it happened in April and May. To get out of the lull I ordered the Koni Sports (yellows) for the car.</p>",2010-12-31 03:00:36.000,html,,,/Blog/itemId/485/350Z-Koni-Shock-Install
Race tire mounting in the San Francisco Bay Area (Peninsula),race-tire-mounting-in-the-san-francisco-bay-area-peninsula,"<p>So as I try to get ready for the 2011 autocross season I stopped into a tire shop the other day, the Les Schwab on El Camino in San Carlos, California.</p>

<p>I was curious how much they would charge to mount and balance for 18” tires. For those of you who don’t autocross, it is very common for autocrossers to need a local tire changing service, while not purchasing the tires from that location as well.</p>

<p>I’ve had placed charge anywhere from $60 to $80. When I asked Les Schwab what they would charge he told me $149, I literally laughed, said thank you, and walked out.</p>

<p>I’ll be tasked now with finding a local shop who will hopefully do it for cheaper. I was spoiled in St. Louis, I had access to the tire machine at <a href=""http://www.soloperformance.com"">www.soloperformance.com</a>, I had a % share in the machine, actually I still do. It might be cheaper just to ship wheels and tires to Dave and have him mount them.</p>

<p>Getting them shipped back though might make that cost prohibitive <img style=""border-bottom-style: none; border-right-style: none; border-top-style: none; border-left-style: none"" class=""wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-smile"" alt=""Smile"" src=""http://www.project350z.com/Portals/4/PublishThumbnails/Windows-Live-Writer/38c1eaeeaf3c_1076/wlEmoticon-smile_2.png"" /></p>

Injen Super SES Installation on the 350z,injen-super-ses-installation-on-the-350z,"<p>If you followed the <a href=""http://www.project350z.com/Articles/itemId/488/Injen-Customer-Service-Update-It-rocks.aspx"">blog post earlier this week</a> you already know that Injen came through and got me the replacement midpipes for my Super SES Exhaust which I removed late last year.</p>

<p>Today I took the OEM exhaust off the 350z and put the Injen exhaust back on. The job itself is easy, probably could do it all in about 25 minutes if I really pushed it, but I didn&rsquo;t. I took my time, cleaned up in the garage a bit, cleaned up the exhaust a bit as well. I also managed to weigh both the Injen exhaust and the OEM exhaust to see what the difference was. I was hoping it would be more!</p>  <table border=""0"" cellspacing=""0"" cellpadding=""2"" width=""613"">      <tbody>          <tr>              <td valign=""top"" style=""width: 225px;""><strong>Exhaust</strong></td>              <td valign=""top"" style=""width: 386px;""><strong>Weight</strong></td>          </tr>          <tr>              <td valign=""top"" style=""width: 225px;"">OEM 350z Exhaust</td>              <td valign=""top"" style=""width: 386px;"">Y-pipe (15lbs) Midpipe (10lbs) Muffler (35lbs)         <br />              <strong>Total 60lbs</strong></td>          </tr>          <tr>              <td valign=""top"" style=""width: 225px;"">Injen Super SES Exhaust</td>              <td valign=""top"" style=""width: 386px;"">Midpipes (10lbs each) Muffler (15lbs each)         <br />              <strong>Total 50lbs</strong></td>          </tr>      </tbody>  </table>  <p><em>(these weights were taken on a standard bathroom scale, not sure of their accuracy)</em></p>

<p>So installing the Super SES Exhaust should save me ~10lbs over the stock setup, providing more flow and hopefully more horse power. I had the car dyno&rsquo;d back in April of 2010 with the original Super SES setup on it, I will have to find the dyno sheets but if I recall correctly it was around 259 to the rear wheels. Not bad considering I believe my first Z in stock form on a totally different dyno setup, did around 219 to the rear.</p>

<p>I setup my GoPro HD today to take a photo every 2 seconds while I was working, I think it turned out well, though a number of the shots are a little dark in the garage, I think I can fix that next time.</p>

"350z Trailer Hitch, Take 2",350z-trailer-hitch-take-2,"<p>So for my 2003 350z I had a custom trailer hitch built by a friend in St. Louis. It was hefty, mounting with ubolts through the bottom of the bumper and then a bar running forward to the differential. It weighed quite a bit, but was somewhat easy to remove at autocross events if I was concerned about the weight. </p>

<p>I just spent the last hour and a half trying to dig up an old photo of the hitch, but have so far been unable to do so! I’m hoping to get some photos from the company who made the hitch (no longer produced or sold, but we’ll see if they still have them). I did finally locate a photo of when the hitch was being built! Though it really isn’t useful for much, here it is. This is the mount at the rear diff.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/5389655042/""><img border=""0"" alt=""CRW_1674_JFR"" src=""http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5220/5389655042_505eb6623c_m.jpg"" width=""240"" height=""159"" /></a></p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> I got some photos from the company who produced the hitch (just a reminder, the company is no longer in business and the hitch is no longer available    <br /><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/5390302769/""><img border=""0"" alt=""350z Trailer Hitch"" src=""http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5131/5390302769_e2cc8da9a7_m.jpg"" width=""240"" height=""180"" /></a>&#160;<a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/5390302985/""><img border=""0"" alt=""350z Trailer Hitch"" src=""http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5298/5390302985_f81ea52fa5_m.jpg"" width=""240"" height=""180"" /></a>&#160;<a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/5390911448/""><img border=""0"" alt=""350z Trailer Hitch"" src=""http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5260/5390911448_87953722dd_m.jpg"" width=""240"" height=""180"" /></a></p>

<p>Then of course there is the car actually towing at trailer. This photo was taken in the parking lot at the Jack Daniel’s Distillery in Lynchburg Tennessee in April 2005, just a few days after the hitch was constructed. I always loved this photo</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/5389048109/""><img border=""0"" alt=""CRW_1711_JFR"" src=""http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5260/5389048109_3d9c0c77bd_m.jpg"" width=""240"" height=""159"" /></a></p>

<p>So why the hitch post now? Well, it’s that time. Time to get a hitch for the 350z, why? Because autocross season is coming up and I need a way to get wheels and tires to the events! So I ordered a <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BROASA?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=chrishammondc-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B000BROASA"">Curt hitch for the 350z</a> today. It’s about as different as can be from the hitch that was on my old car.</p>

<p>It mounts only to the bumper, and requires trimming the rear bumper cover a bit. I’m not too big a fan of that, but it appears to be the only real option for hitches at this point. I am going to see if I need to reinforce anything when I get the hitch on and a trailer.</p>

<p>Previously, as you can see in the photo I had a rather large trailer, a 6x8. I purchased the 6x8 so that I could haul a couple of sets of tires (I think the most I ever carried was 3, plus a motorcycle. I am pretty sure I don’t have any pictures of the motorcycle on the trailer behind the Camaro (which was what I had at the time).</p>

<p>I don’t know exactly what I will do for a trailer this time around, I will likely get something a little bigger than standard harbor freight tire trailer (I would like to be able to carry two sets of tires), though I won’t buy brand new like I did last time. I will probably peruse craigslist when the time comes, I just found a 4x6 enclosed utility trailer on there for $200 this evening that would be something that could work (when the time comes).</p>

<p>I’ll do a video/blog post of the hitch install this weekend if I can get to it. I’m hoping to hit the NorCalUFO autocross in Marina on Sunday.</p>",2011-01-26 01:09:16.000,html,,,/Blog/itemId/490/350z-Trailer-Hitch-Take-2

The 350z goes on a Diet,the-350z-goes-on-a-diet,"<p>On Saturday the 350z went on a diet, losing (rough guess here) about 3% of it’s total weight.</p>

<p>When I purchased the car in January of 2010 I knew a few things. The stereo in the car was aftermarket, and so were the two 10” subs in the back of the car. Beyond that I also assumed there was an amplifier somewhere powering the subs, but I wasn’t really sure what else there was.</p>

<p>I decided to remove the subwoofers so that I could drop some weight in the car. I liked the sound, but this car has a purpose, autocross, and the subs were not designed for that purpose.</p>

<p>Yesterday I found out what else was in there. There were TWO amps behind the driver’s seat in the compartment where the stock subwoofer would go on a Bose equipped 350z. They were in there mounted to a wooden structure, but ultimately just floating around in the compartment. That means they probably got a good tossing or two at the two autocrosses I went to previously.</p>

<p>Once I started getting the interior paneling out of the car so that I could remove the sub enclosure I located the amplifiers, and then I started to discover that all of the speakers in the car were being powered by the amps, which told me that they were not likely wired up to the stock stereo harness anymore. </p>

<p>I could have left the amps in and the speakers, and only removed the sub enclosure, but I decided if I was going to try to make this car competitive in BSP (hopefully ESP for 2012) I was going to have to go all in. So I pulled it all. I removed the subs, amps, speakers, and even the stereo from the dash. Fortunately for me BSP allows removal of the stereo/speakers as long as you don’t remove the OEM wiring, so I was covered there.</p>

<p>All in all I pulled out about 100lbs of equipment from the car. 45 for the sub+enclosure, 40 for the amps/bracket, and probably 5-6lbs of wiring (remember it wasn’t using the stock wiring, the power and grounds were 2 gauge, HUGE wires. The 4 speakers and the stereo itself easily weighing in around 10lbs, for a total of around 100lbs.</p>

<p>Not a bad diet for a day’s work. I’ll talk more about what I am doing for tunes in tomorrow’s blog post where I review the first autocross of 2011. For now here’s the video from the stereo removal.</p>  <div style=""padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; float: none; padding-top: 0px"" id=""scid:5737277B-5D6D-4f48-ABFC-DD9C333F4C5D:739a7655-a90d-4d42-b929-2a56448fe3b4"" class=""wlWriterEditableSmartContent""><div id=""64bd917b-9b78-426d-b119-19a4b59e16c1"" style=""margin: 0px; padding: 0px; display: inline;""><div><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGqoF9s0djQ&amp;feature=youtube_gdata_player"" target=""_new""><img src=""http://www.project350z.com/Portals/4/PublishThumbnails/Windows-Live-Writer/The-350z-goes-on-a-Diet_12F66/videoc902b241d5d3.jpg"" style=""border-style: none"" galleryimg=""no"" onload=""var downlevelDiv = document.getElementById('64bd917b-9b78-426d-b119-19a4b59e16c1'); downlevelDiv.innerHTML = &quot;&lt;div&gt;&lt;object width=\&quot;448\&quot; height=\&quot;252\&quot;&gt;&lt;param name=\&quot;movie\&quot; value=\&quot;http://www.youtube.com/v/GGqoF9s0djQ?hl=en&amp;hd=1\&quot;&gt;&lt;\/param&gt;&lt;embed src=\&quot;http://www.youtube.com/v/GGqoF9s0djQ?hl=en&amp;hd=1\&quot; type=\&quot;application/x-shockwave-flash\&quot; width=\&quot;448\&quot; height=\&quot;252\&quot;&gt;&lt;\/embed&gt;&lt;\/object&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;&quot;;"" alt=""""></a></div></div><div style=""width:448px;clear:both;font-size:.8em"">350z Stereo Removal (autocross weight savings)</div></div>",2011-01-31 00:49:00.000,html,,,/Blog/itemId/492/The-350z-goes-on-a-Diet
How do you travel with your video equipment?,how-do-you-travel-with-your-video-equipment,"<p>So this isn’t the blog post I had intended to write today, but I think it’s a useful one nonetheless.</p>

<p>For those of you who autocross, or partake in any other motorsports. How do you travel with your video equipment? Discussion on where you mount your cameras and such, and what types of cameras will be left for another set of blog posts, but for now, how do you get your equipment to a race?</p>

<p>If you’re a small time autocrosser like me, you likely aren’t towing your car around on an enclosed trailer with lots of storage space.</p>

<p>At this point I have 3-6 potential video cameras I could take/use at any one race. Two GoPro’s (one HD and one of the SUPER CRAPPY original versions), a Chase Cam/PDR, plus a Canon HV10, 5d Mark II and a point and shoot that will do video. Now granted, I will almost likely never put the 5d Mark II on the car, I do take it to events so that I can take photos.</p>

<p>So what’s the best way to get things to an event? Right now I’m packing things into a lowepro 300aw, and that is probably the best solution for the time being, but with all that equipment I’m going to have to trim back what I put in the bag (less lenses for the 5D).</p>

<p>What do you use? A Pelican case? A bag? Something else? </p>",2011-01-31 19:42:27.000,html,,,/Blog/itemId/493/How-do-you-travel-with-your-video-equipment
Autocross Video from NorCalUFO 1/30/11,autocross-video-from-norcalufo-1/30/11,"<p>Sunday I partook in the NorCalUFO autocross, their second event of the year, my first attending since the baby was born in October. I got to the event and heard that they had a course worker get hit at their last event, unfortunately he was hurt pretty bad and of course doesn’t have insurance, so they were taking donations. I assume that their insurance doesn’t cover the injuries? I believe (could be wrong) that SCCA events always have insurance that would cover someone who got injured, but perhaps I’m wrong. The odd thing is this is the SECOND course worker they’ve had hit in the past 6 or 9 months. Not exactly something that you want to hear when you show up. (Mental note, keep that in mind when signing up for worker positions)</p>

<p>WOOOOOOWHOOOO! Fun at an autocross again. It’s been a few events since I’ve really had fun at an autocross. This time around I was still on the crappy street tires, which actually I think are worse than before as the rears are getting pretty bald, it was wet, so that made things more interesting.</p>

<p>I started out the morning by driving down to Marina (about an hour and 40 minutes), stopping to get a bite to eat, and then to grab a gallon of gas when I got there. I got to the site around 7:30am and got registered for BSP, and signed up for the “course monitor” work assignment for the 4th run group.</p>

<p>I took 3 video cameras with me (4 if you count my DSLR), my GoProHD, my original GoPro and my ChaseCam. Unfortunately the original GoPro is such as POS that it failed to work for a single run… go figure. I love the GoProHD, but I tell you being an early adopter of GoPro (I got the first one in December 2007) was a mistake, their original cameras just flat out suck. If anyone from GoPro is reading this, I will gladly trade you guys my original one for another GoProHD, contact me!</p>

<p>My first run I went out with tire pressures around 48/46psi, it was like a drifter’s dream, wet surface, bald tires with high pressure, the rear end was moving around like a girl putting herself through college in east St. Louis. Here’s a video of the run, both from the top of the car, and inset with the passenger side view of the right front tire, watch all over the steering correction while the car dances.</p>  <div style=""padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; float: none; padding-top: 0px"" id=""scid:5737277B-5D6D-4f48-ABFC-DD9C333F4C5D:fd1e2d43-f6f7-44da-bf1d-9da13f237801"" class=""wlWriterEditableSmartContent""><div id=""9543b44a-b7f4-41e7-a478-acbcdd1022ac"" style=""margin: 0px; padding: 0px; display: inline;""><div><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjCFiWwO6GA&amp;feature=youtube_gdata_player"" target=""_new""><img src=""http://www.project350z.com/Portals/4/PublishThumbnails/Windows-Live-Writer/Autocross-Video-from-13011_13493/videoce295b8c8fbb.jpg"" style=""border-style: none"" galleryimg=""no"" onload=""var downlevelDiv = document.getElementById('9543b44a-b7f4-41e7-a478-acbcdd1022ac'); downlevelDiv.innerHTML = &quot;&lt;div&gt;&lt;object width=\&quot;734\&quot; height=\&quot;411\&quot;&gt;&lt;param name=\&quot;movie\&quot; value=\&quot;http://www.youtube.com/v/zjCFiWwO6GA?hl=en&amp;hd=1\&quot;&gt;&lt;\/param&gt;&lt;embed src=\&quot;http://www.youtube.com/v/zjCFiWwO6GA?hl=en&amp;hd=1\&quot; type=\&quot;application/x-shockwave-flash\&quot; width=\&quot;734\&quot; height=\&quot;411\&quot;&gt;&lt;\/embed&gt;&lt;\/object&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;&quot;;"" alt=""""></a></div></div><div style=""width:734px;clear:both;font-size:.8em"">Run #1 for Project350z.com on 1/30/11 BEST VIEWED IN HD</div></div>  <p>&#160;</p>

<p>With all that moving around I was sure when I cross the finish lights I had taken out at least 4 cones, but the final results show only 1, but a nice and slow time of 53 seconds.</p>

<p>The second run was a little better than the first, improving on raw time, and clean. The third run however is another story, I was going okay until a couple of turns before the finish when the rear of the car decided to do the old Sauget shuffle and batted a few cones off course (video coming soon) My third run was the fastest up to that point, but I had 4 cones today based on the results.</p>  <div style=""padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; float: none; padding-top: 0px"" id=""scid:5737277B-5D6D-4f48-ABFC-DD9C333F4C5D:ca8d6810-195d-4a99-a187-79e4e29b212c"" class=""wlWriterEditableSmartContent""><div id=""547183ec-da84-40d3-9d85-bbe055fd40b1"" style=""margin: 0px; padding: 0px; display: inline;""><div><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Xq9NICjUJA&amp;feature=youtube_gdata_player"" target=""_new""><img src=""http://www.project350z.com/Portals/4/PublishThumbnails/Windows-Live-Writer/Autocross-Video-from-13011_13493/video30047205e2eb.jpg"" style=""border-style: none"" galleryimg=""no"" onload=""var downlevelDiv = document.getElementById('547183ec-da84-40d3-9d85-bbe055fd40b1'); downlevelDiv.innerHTML = &quot;&lt;div&gt;&lt;object width=\&quot;733\&quot; height=\&quot;412\&quot;&gt;&lt;param name=\&quot;movie\&quot; value=\&quot;http://www.youtube.com/v/3Xq9NICjUJA?hl=en&amp;hd=1\&quot;&gt;&lt;\/param&gt;&lt;embed src=\&quot;http://www.youtube.com/v/3Xq9NICjUJA?hl=en&amp;hd=1\&quot; type=\&quot;application/x-shockwave-flash\&quot; width=\&quot;733\&quot; height=\&quot;412\&quot;&gt;&lt;\/embed&gt;&lt;\/object&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;&quot;;"" alt=""""></a></div></div><div style=""width:733px;clear:both;font-size:.8em"">Run #3 for Project350z.com on 1/30/11 BEST VIEWED IN HD</div></div>  <p>My 4th and final run was when the fun finally kicked in. The course was starting to dry out more and I took a serious drop in tire pressure, going down to 38/36. Talk about a big improvement, the tires were starting to squeal (I hate street tires) due to the drying surface. I got down to around a 48.9 on that run. Much improvement, not enough to put me into the lead in BSP but I was happy with a very under prepared car on super cheap street tires.</p>

<p>I’m already signed up for the SFRSCCA Divisional which is running the weekend of 2/19.

"Wheels for a BSP 350z, ARP Studs, Sway Bars",wheels-for-a-bsp-350z-arp-studs-sway-bars,"<p>So now that wheels and tires (used) are taken care of, at least for part of the season, I need to locate some longer/stronger wheel studs for the 350z. </p>

<p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/5419830808/""><img style=""display: inline; float: right"" border=""0"" alt=""Enkei RPF1 18x10 +38"" align=""right"" src=""http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5293/5419830808_08eb37234e_m.jpg"" width=""240"" height=""180"" /></a></p>

<p>On my 2003 350z I had Nismo studs, though they were only on the front, I never got around to putting them on the rear. For this one I could go with the Nismo studs, but it appears a lot of people use ARP studs. So I started looking into what was available there.</p>

<p>The guy I purchased the wheels and tires from uses studs that have a 1.50 pitch, though stock and the Nismo studs were 1.25.</p>

<p>Doing some research it looks like ARP’s catalog doesn’t have any listings for Nissans, but based on the specs I found on another website they make a couple of part numbers that would likely work.</p>

<p>Part Number 100-7717 has a knurl (where it goes into the hub) diameter of .565 or ~14.3mm, a length of 3”, knurl length of .270”, and thread size of M12x1.5</p>

<p>Part Number 100-7716 has a knurl (where it goes into the hub) diameter of .565 or ~14.3mm, a length of 3”, knurl length of .270”, and thread size of M12x1.25</p>

<p>I obviously haven’t yet confirmed these fit yet (I’ll update this post when I do), but I’m going to see what I can find for a deal on either of the above part numbers. I’m likely going to need them on my 350z with these new wheels and potentially need spacers as well.</p>

<p>The wheels I picked up are Enkei RPF1 18x10” +38 for all four corners. The tires are used Kumho Victoracer V710s 18” 305. Not what I want to run ultimately, but the best option for me right now as they were already mounted on the wheels!</p>

<p>In addition to the wheels and tires I picked up a set of used front and rear Hotchkis sway bars for the 350z. They are the older set, only 3 adjustment points, but they will do for now. </p>

These are brand new Falken RT615s 265/35R18. Not sure when I will get them mounted, but I’m looking forward to having them on the car. </p>

<p>The first event of 2011 for the San Francisco Region SCCA is on the 13th, so a week away. In that time I need to get the following done</ul>
<p>   <li>Find 20 long studs </li>    <li>Find 20 (+) lug nuts </li>    <li>Find sway bar end links </li>    <li>Install the sway bars </li>    <li>Make sure that the new wheels/tires fit on the car. </li>    <li>Make sure I can fit 4 wheels/tires in the car so I can get to the event. </li> </ul>",2011-02-05 23:07:21.000,html,,,/Blog/itemId/496/Wheels-for-a-BSP-350z-ARP-Studs-Sway-Bars
350z Tire/Wheel Fitment 18x10 inch 305 V710s,350z-tire/wheel-fitment-18x10-inch-305-v710s,"<p>This evening after work I came home and cleared out the garage so that I could get the new wheels test fitted to see what all I was going to need to do on Saturday.</p>

<p>Here are the details, the wheels are Enkei RPF1 18”x10” +38 (offset). The tires are Kumho Ecsta V710 305/30/18s. The car currently sits on a stock suspension (2004 350z Enthusiast)</p>

<p>With that in mind, I wanted to see what I was going to need to do to make them fit on the car so I can run them at the SCCA Autocross this weekend. The good news is that the wheels/tires fit on the rear perfectly, no changes necessary (at least as of right now on the stock suspension).</p>

<p>The wheels and tires unfortunately do not fit on the front, but I kind of expected that, and was surprised they fit on the rear without any trouble. So in order to get the wheels on the front of the car I’m going to need to do a few things.</p>  <ol>   <li>I need spacers up front, I test fitted a single and double 5mm spacer, 5mm wasn’t enough, but 10mm looks to be right. So in the front I’ll need 10mm at minimum, though I may order a few different spacers for future needs.</li>    <li>Longer studs, I ended up ordering some ARP Studs (part number 100-7717) from <a href=""http://www.soloperformance.com"">www.soloperformance.com</a> via special order. They should be here Friday, in time for me to install them on Saturday. I ordered rear studs as well, but may not put those on immediately.</li>    <li>New lug nuts, with the longer studs I’ll need an open lug nut, I’ll pick those up at autozone or kragen.</li> </ol>  <p>I think, and we’ll see in a few months, that I can probably get 315s all the way around on these wheels, and with appropriate spacers, that 315 will fit.</p>

Nope those lug nuts won&rsquo;t fit,nope-those-lug-nuts-wont-fit,"<p>So I ran around Redwood City today over lunch, I needed to find some spacers and lug nuts to go along with the new studs that arrived today from <a href=""http://www.soloperformance.com"">www.soloperformance.com</a>.</p>

<p>I went to Kragen first, they didn’t have any spacers but were kind enough to point me towards <a href=""http://www.fivepointtire.com"">Five Point Tire</a> in Redwood City. Five Point was great, service was awesome and the guy was very helpful. I picked up 6 spacers, with the intention of only using 2 or 4 of them for now.</p>

<p>When I got home I wanted to make sure that the lugs were going to work. They were Gorilla Lug nuts, designed to go through the holes in the wheels to help position them on the hub. Unfortunately when I test fitted them though the wheels they don’t actually fit through the holes <img style=""border-bottom-style: none; border-right-style: none; border-top-style: none; border-left-style: none"" class=""wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-sadsmile"" alt=""Sad smile"" src=""http://www.project350z.com/Portals/4/PublishThumbnails/Windows-Live-Writer/62ecb0783f7c_127C9/wlEmoticon-sadsmile_2.png"" /></p>

<p>Looks like I will need to run to Five Point Tire again Friday or Saturday and see what their options are. I will likely take a wheel with me this time to make sure things work out. </p>",2011-02-11 00:08:16.000,html,,,/Blog/itemId/498/Nope-those-lug-nuts-wont-fit
Prepping for the 350z Stud Install,prepping-for-the-350z-stud-install,"<p>I was going to do a blog post on ChrisHammond.com tonight with a video embedded that I took at the NASA Ames Research Center tweetup, but unfortunately the video I produced came out at 800mb and between youtube and my connection it doesn’t look like that video is going to be ready for the public to view tonight.</p>

<p>So instead I’m going to post here on Project350z.com. Why? Well in last night’s post I mentioned that the Lug Nuts I picked up from Five Point Tire Imports wouldn’t fit in the wheels for the car. So today I went by there again (after the tweetup) and replaced the lug nuts with ones that should fit on the car just fine.</p>

<p>I did some reading tonight, and dug around in my service manual, so that I can get the car into the garage in the morning and start installing the new longer studs (after removing the OEM shorter studs).</p>

<p>I also picked up a second GoProHD battery pack today, so if I run out of juice on the GoPro tomorrow while working on the car I should be able to swap it easily and extend my recording.</p>",2011-02-12 01:52:45.000,html,,,/Blog/itemId/499/Prepping-for-the-350z-Stud-Install
My GoPro HD Died,my-gopro-hd-died,"<p>So I ran into a few issues today with my GoPro HD. I was working on the car, and was going to do another time lapse, even picked up a second battery last night so that I was sure I would get as much as possible.</p>

<p>Then my GoPro HD crapped out on me. It turns out there’s a Time Lapse bug that when it takes the 9999 photo (in the camera’s life) it freaks out and starts creating tons of folders, and stops taking photos. So I tried updating the firmware to fix the bug, but somehow managed to totally hose the GoPro HD all together. Now it won’t turn on.</p>

San Francisco Region SCCA Boondoggle 2011 Results,san-francisco-region-scca-boondoggle-2011-results,"<p>So today was the first day for a few things</p>  <ol>      <li>It was my first time running an autocross with the San Francisco Region of the SCCA. I must say things went fairly well, even with of the normal first event hiccups. </li>
<li>It was my first time running this 350z on RComps, and any 350z on 18&rdquo; tires on 10&rdquo; wide wheels. Overall I was impressed, though I long for 315 Hoosier A6s!</li>  </ol>  <p>Today&rsquo;s event was held at California&rsquo;s Great America in Santa Clara, CA. I started out slow, but finally kicked it in gear a bit on my 4th and final run. I realized today that I used to drive balls to the wall all the time at an autocross, I guess in my old age I&rsquo;m not doing that as much, so it took me a while to turn that switch back on.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s video of my first run, 42.7** seconds, 2 cones. Check out some of that inside tire spin, a definite sign that I need to get a new LSD.</p>

<p>[YouTube:U7MrArldr9M]</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s my fourth run, I wish I had adjusted the rear camera a bit better, but I can&rsquo;t change that now.</p>

<p>[YouTube:xtcxoTIstr8]</p>

<p>I was shooting video with the <a href=""http://www.chasecam.com"" target=""_blank"">ChaseCam</a> and my original GoPro, my GoPro HD had some issues and no longer works. I&rsquo;m hoping I can get a replacement for it ASAP as next weekend is a two day divisional also being held at Great America, though fortunately this time on a bigger lot, today was awful cramped mid day when all the second session drivers and first session drivers were trying to park and such.</p>

<p>So how did I end up for the day? Well, I was running in the Index ( X ) class, and I got stomped! I finished 17 out of 22 in the class, 41st or so overall on the event index. I think I would have been in 3rd place out of 6 had I been running BSP with the regular class.</p>",2011-02-13 23:58:50.000,html,,,/Blog/itemId/501/San-Francisco-Region-SCCA-Boondoggle-2011-Result
Night before the Project 350z&rsquo;s first divisional,night-before-the-project-350zs-first-divisional,"<p>So today was a busy day, I had a lot to catch up on at work, training to provide internally, and a final to take this afternoon. After that I ran home and grabbed the set of Falken Azenis RT-615s that were sitting in the garage and ran to Les Schwab (<a href=""http://www.project350z.com/Articles/itemId/486/Race-tire-mounting-in-the-San-Francisco-Bay-Area-.aspx"">the same place I bitched about a few weeks ago</a>) to get them mounted.</p>

<p>They weren’t too thrilled about what I had to offer them, but they did get them mounted (took a while though). A 265 35 18 on an 18x8” wheel is not idea according to them, but they did it nonetheless and I appreciate it. Why the rush to get street tires mounted? It’s been raining here for what seems like weeks and with the divisional being tomorrow morning I wanted to be prepared. I am taking the V710s, but I figured having a new set of street tires would be a good idea if I decided there was too much water for the V710s. I also figured the set that was on there was a little old and bald, not exactly safe in the rain.</p>

<p>So tomorrow morning begins another autocross, a two day divisional at Great America in Santa Clara. I went down to register tonight but they had closed up the registration due to all the rain coming down, so I at least found out my work assignment (3rd heat announce) and spent some time driving with my wife and baby.</p>

<p>I’ll have video up tomorrow night of the event, we’ll see how things go. I’m hoping it dries a little so that the V710s can have some fun.</p>",2011-02-19 00:52:11.000,html,,,/Blog/itemId/502/Night-before-the-Project-350zs-first-divisional

Very cold and very wet. I went to Great America today for the SFRSCCA Divisional Autocross. I got there around 7am and put the Kumho tires on the car, big mistake! I was sort of drying out, the sky was almost clear, but the drive down there was rainy, and there was snow! You can’t see it very well in this picture, but yes, there was snow in the “hills” around the Bay Area.</p>

<p>So I installed the wheels/tires and walked the course a few times. The driver’s meeting got delayed, then the start of the event got delayed. Then the rain started back up <img style=""border-bottom-style: none; border-right-style: none; border-top-style: none; border-left-style: none"" class=""wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-sadsmile"" alt=""Sad smile"" src=""http://www.project350z.com/Portals/4/PublishThumbnails/Windows-Live-Writer/SFRSCCA-Divisional-2011-Day-1_10487/wlEmoticon-sadsmile_2.png"" /></p>

<p>Let me tell you this, Kumho V710s don’t work well when it is &lt;40 degrees and raining. My first run I went out and it felt horrible, I turned a 66.*, I wasn’t too thrilled about that. Here’s a video of that run.</p>

<p>[YouTube:WV9E75Gkc-Y]</p>

<p>But I was too lazy to go get my street tires (<a href=""http://www.project350z.com/Articles/itemId/502/Night-before-the-Project-350zrsquos-first-divisi.aspx"">freshly mounted the previous night mind you</a>). Big mistake, I went out on my second run and decided I would take things slower, expecting to actually go around the course faster. I slowed down and ran a 69.*. That broke this camel’s back, I ran off to get my street wheels, drill, and jack so that I could swap to the Falken Azenis RT-615s.</p>

<p>Thankfully Grant (in a Nismo 370z) followed me over and helped me bring 2 of the tires back to my grid spot. I don’t think I would have gotten them changed in time had he not helped! Thanks for the help Grant!</p>

<p>The Falkens were MUCH better, not perfect, but way better than the V710s in the rain. I managed to run a 60.*, a big improvement over the first two runs, though I just wish I had put them on before my second run, or even to begin with!</p>

<p>Here’s a video of the third run</p>

Weighing the 350z at the Divisional,weighing-the-350z-at-the-divisional,"<p>So there&rsquo;s been much debate (or really just many people telling me I am crazy) over on SCCAForums in the thread I started to discuss the proposed move of the 350z from BSP to ESP in SCCA Autocross classing.</p>

<p>Ever since the 350z was released I thought it was the perfect F-Stock car, though others have always seemed to think otherwise and it was relegated to B-Stock where all but a few events it became an also ran behind the RX-8. It was also classed in BSP (b street prepared) where it hasn&rsquo;t faired any better for the last 8 years. Last month the SCCA posted a proposal to move the 350z from BSP to ESP, I&rsquo;m all for the move, most of the ESP folk apparently aren&rsquo;t, &ldquo;A Japanese car in our American Car Class? How dare you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alright, so no one has made that complaint, but the way they &ldquo;defend&rdquo; their ground they might as well be drawing lines in the soil. There&rsquo;s much debate about what a 350z will actually weight in SP trim, my car isn&rsquo;t fully SP prepped yet (and to be honest that will likely take 2-3 years due to budget) but I figured I would go ahead and weigh the car at the divisional event today.</p>

<p>First things first, here are the details of the car itself (if it's not mentioned it is stock)   <br />  2004 Nissan 350z ""Enthusiast"" package    <br />  18x10"" RPF1s    <br />  305 V710s    <br />  No stereo/speakers    <br />  ~2 gallons of gas    <br />  Injen Super SES dual exhaust (weighed at 15lbs lighter than stock)    <br />  HFCs    <br />  K&amp;N CAI    <br />  Plenum spacer    <br />  Hotchkis F/R sway bars    <br />  No spare tire, tools, or rear carpeting/mats(not fastened down from the factory)</p>

<p>And what did it weigh in at?</p>

<p><strong>3062lbs</strong></p>

<p>That matches up fairly closely to my 2003 Enthusiast I had from 03-06 in b-stock trim. A few other mods on this one, though the old one had a lighter exhaust setup. The 2003 weighed 3075lbs.</p>",2011-02-21 00:09:56.000,html,,,/Blog/itemId/504/Weighing-the-350z-at-the-Divisional
350z Autocross Tire Pressures,350z-autocross-tire-pressures,"<p>So with all the blogging I&rsquo;ve done over the years I have been unable to find any posts where I mentioned tire pressures!</p>

<p>So here it is, a thread that I will continually update with tire pressure information for my 350z. As I change configurations I will move settings to an archive down below.</p>  <h2>Current Tires</h2>  <p>Kumho V710 305/30R18   <br />  (as of 2/20/2011)</p>  <h2>Current Pressures</h2>  <p>Front: 25psi   <br />  Rear: 23psi    <br />  (as of 2/20/2011, 3/6/2011)</p>",2011-02-21 00:18:38.000,html,,,/Blog/itemId/505/350z-Autocross-Tire-Pressures
350z Traction Control and Square Tires,350z-traction-control-and-square-tires,"<p>So I experienced something while driving the 350z yesterday that I haven’t experienced in quite a while. Typically the 350z comes with a staggered tire setup, meaning that the front tires are usually a smaller size than the rears. A week or two ago I got some new street tires put on the car, the new tires are “square” meaning the fronts are the same size as the rear.</p>

<p>This actually gives you the ability to rotate the wheels/tires (assuming the wheels are the same size), which can go a long way in making your tires last longer. The old set I had taken off were actually okay in the front, but the rears were bald, being able to rotate could have helped prevent that.</p>

<p>The downfall of having a square setup, at least with a 350z, is that the computer isn’t setup for that, not having the stagger causes the front tires to run at a different speed in relation to the rear tires. This causes the computer to freak out, though most of the time it is fine, where it will freak out is typically when you are accelerating on an onramp.</p>

<p>I had this happen for the first time since some time in 2006 (when I sold my first 350z) last night. It wasn’t a huge shocker, but it was a bit of a surprise. You can avoid the computer issue, but it requires turning off the traction control, something you can’t do when it is activated by the differing speeds. So for now, I will continue to turn off the traction control (tcs) when I get in the car.</p>

<p>I’m curious to see if there are any ways to disable the TCS by default, and only have it turn on when you press the button. That would be extremely useful in autocross as you NEVER want traction control in a 350z enabled when autocrossing.</p>",2011-03-02 23:05:49.000,html,,,/Blog/itemId/506/350z-Traction-Control-and-Square-Tires
Excellent customer service from GoPro,excellent-customer-service-from-gopro,"<p>The night before an autocross, and I’m stoked for tomorrow, even if it rains (as forecasted). I got a replacement GoPro HD camera today in the mail.</p>

<p>For those of you who don’t know, I had a problem with my GoPro camera, which I use a LOT! I use it for <a href=""http://www.project350z.com/Videos.aspx"">autocross videos, and time lapse videos of working on the car</a>. A few weeks ago I was working on the car doing a standard time lapse, but the camera freaked out. I came to find out that there was a bug in the camera software that would show up with time lapse mode after 10k (I think) photos were taken. It was a known bug though, and there was a firmware update for the camera to fix the bug.</p>

<p>So I applied the firmware update, but something during the process failed and the camera ended up “bricking” which basically means it wouldn’t work. You couldn’t power it on, you couldn’t use it, nothing, it was as useful as a brick. Since I got the camera for xmas it was still under warranty so I contacted GoPro about getting it fixed, while it took a bit of back and forth via email with their customer service reps, they provided me with an RMA number to send it in.</p>

<p>This was a couple of weeks ago, right before a 2 day autocross and right before we were heading out of town for vacation, so I didn’t get the camera mailed out until Tuesday of this week. On Thursday I got an email from them saying that they had a replacement camera ready to mail out, but I hadn’t included a return address. I replied with our address, and then on Friday I got an email saying it would go out. It is nice that we live about 15 miles from their headquarters because the camera showed up today via USPS.</p>

<p>I’m not positive that the firmware fix has been applied to this camera yet, but I’m going to leave it as is for now. I want to use it at the autocross tomorrow, so I don’t want to run the risk of bricking it again!</p>",2011-03-05 23:02:50.000,html,,,/Blog/itemId/507/Excellent-customer-service-from-GoPro
Top 10 PAX!,top-10-pax,"<p>So I went to the autocross today, kind of a last minute thing, and boy am I glad I did.</p>

<p>I left the house at 11:30am, got there and changed tires and then ran around 2pm (or after due to a bunch of timing issues).</p>

<p>I was pleased with my runs, my time being faster than a few cars I was sick of being beat by (ST civics!). Though when I went to check the results I was in 6th out of 7 in the Index class I run. I run Index, not in the standard BSP class at SCCA events because I want to compete against the fastest of the fast, no offense to the regular BSP competitors.</p>

<p>6th of 7, eh, at least I wasn’t DFL. But then tonight when the <a href=""http://www.sfr-solo.org/solo2/Results/2011/Championship/round04.html"">results are posted</a> I ended up 10th on the overall index for the event! Woot!</p>

<p>*happy dance*</p>

<p>I believe the first heat of the day had a drying course, and the event overall was smaller (122 drivers) but I’ll gladly take a 10th on overall index any day here in the Bay Area!</p>

<p>I’ll post videos from the event tomorrow. I would have had three angles, but my original GoPro is such a POS that it didn’t get a single recorded video. </p>",2011-03-07 00:46:01.000,html,,,/Blog/itemId/508/Top-10-PAX
The suspension is here! Now to fix it,the-suspension-is-here-now-to-fix-it,"<p>My birthday gift (early) from my wife showed up today (I have the best wife ever!), a new suspension (well new to me) for the 350z. There’s only one problem (and not her fault, as I ordered it) the control arms that came aren’t legal for the class the car is being built for.</p>

<p>The problem with them is that the arms use spherical bearings in place of bushings, and the BSP rules read </p>  <blockquote>   <p>15.8.C. Suspension bushings may be replaced with bushings of any materials      <br />(except metal) as long as they fit in the original location. Offset       <br />bushings may be used. <font style=""background-color: #ffff00"">In a replacement bushing the amount        <br />of metal relative to the amount of non-metallic material may not be         <br />increased.</font> This does not authorize a change in type of bushing (for       <br />example ball and socket replacing a cylindrical bushing), or use of       <br />a bushing with an angled hole whose direction differs from that of       <br />the original bushing. If the Stock bushing accommodated multi-axis       <br />motion via compliance of the component material(s), the replacement       <br />bushing may not be changed to accommodate such motion       <br />via change in bushing type, for example to a spherical bearing or       <br />similar component involving internal moving parts. Pins or keys may       <br />be used to prevent the rotation of alternate bushings, but may serve       <br />no other purpose than that of retaining the bushing in the desired       <br />position. Differential mount bushings are not considered to be suspension       <br />bushings and are not covered by this allowance.</p> </blockquote>  <p>Here’s what the arms look like, pretty sweet! I’ve emailed the manufacturer to see if they make another option for the bushing, I don’t expect that they do, but we will see. From there I will have to see if I can get something fabricated, or may have to go with another manufacturer’s part.</p>

"Suspension plans, sort of",suspension-plans-sort-of,"<p>So I wasn’t able to find a part that would make the SPL Upper Control Arms legal for BSP yet, though I am still looking.</p>

<p>As an interim, possibly long term, solution, I have some new offset bushings that should be here soon. John Coffey at <a href=""http://www.betamotorsports.com"">www.betamotorsports.com</a> made two sets of Hydlar Z offset bushings. One set for his car, and then one set to sell. Apparently he sold them once, but the buyer sent them back as he wasn’t up for the fabrication involved in installing them. I on the other hand am game (at least I hope).</p>

<p>I’ll be installing everything this Saturday, it’ll be a long day, but hopefully I can get everything installed. I unfortunately won’t be able to do an alignment on the car, at least not likely, but if I can get done I may try to run somewhere and have it done. Hopefully things turn out!</p>

"Weekend plans, suspension install",weekend-plans-suspension-install,"<p>It will likely be a full weekend for me, lots of suspension work to do on the car. Though the biggest task might be making room in the garage so I can get the car inside! Typically when I’m working on the car I move a lot of stuff out to make room, but it is supposed to rain for the next 5-10 days, so I doubt I’ll be able to move too much outside. I may have to move some things inside into my office for the interim.</p>

"Suspension, FAIL",suspension-fail,"<p>No, the suspension didn&rsquo;t break, but man did murphy show up in full force today.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll do a full write up with photos and what to do, where, etc, later this week, but for now let&rsquo;s talk about what went wrong!</p>

<p>The rear of the car was great, only a couple of minor issues. The first issue was that one of the rear shocks didn&rsquo;t have the nut that came with the original Konis so that the upper mount could attach. Not a huge deal as I had a spare nut to use. Then when I went to put it on the car I found out that I was missing two other nuts, for the lower mount/bolt. I didn&rsquo;t have anything for those so I had to run to Ace Hardware to pick something up. I also got some anti-seize because I remember how much of a pain the lower bolt was on my old 350z, so much that I left the shocks on it when I sold it because I couldn&rsquo;t get them off.</p>

<p>Not a huge deal like I said, I got the rear squared away.</p>

<p><a title=""Rear Suspension Complete"" href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/17726343@N00/5545390097/""><img alt=""Rear Suspension Complete"" src=""http://static.flickr.com/5134/5545390097_6d382db3da.jpg"" style=""border-width: 0px;border-style: solid;"" /></a></p>

<p>The fronts however were a different story. Everything came off easily, even the oem control arms. I quickly realized that I wasn&rsquo;t going to be able to get the bushings out though, I was going to need to have them pressed out. Not a huge deal, I could put the other control arms on, the SPL arms that I got with all the suspension. I wasn&rsquo;t planning on using the SPL arms, because they aren&rsquo;t legal for the class I am running in Autocross, but I could put them on for a few days while I finished up the OEM arms and custom bushings.</p>

<p>I did try to burn the bushings out, and while I caused a mess and got some nice burning rubber fumes floating around the garage, I didn&rsquo;t get very far. Here&rsquo;s a photo of the before and after</p>

<p>Before    <br />  <a title=""OEM UCA Bushings"" href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/17726343@N00/5545397739/""><img alt=""OEM UCA Bushings"" src=""http://static.flickr.com/5095/5545397739_64459e05c7.jpg"" style=""border-width: 0px;border-style: solid;"" /></a></p>

<p>After    <br />  <a title=""What's left the the OEM Bushing"" href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/17726343@N00/5545402039/""><img alt=""What's left the the OEM Bushing"" src=""http://static.flickr.com/5257/5545402039_c84c4f8115.jpg"" style=""border-width: 0px;border-style: solid;"" /></a></p>

<p>So I started to put things together, the front coilovers back on, and I started to bolt them in place. Problem. The TrueChoice Koni coilovers unfortunately don&rsquo;t use the same bolt as the stock struts did. And guess what? I didn&rsquo;t have anything that would work. I ended up driving around town for 2 hours this afternoon trying to find a bolt that would work. I found something, but it was class 8.8, which from my reading is equivalent to grade 5. Most likely not strong enough, but I went ahead and tried to use them anyways.</p>

<p>Then, next thing. I put this bolt in place, and then started to attach the upper control arm back in place. That&rsquo;s when I ran into the next problem. The SPL arm&rsquo;s ball joint uses a different size bolt than the OEM ball joints, so here I am again, without the parts needed to put the car back together. I ended up getting the car rollable so I could get it entirely into the garage, then put it back up on jack stands in the front, then removed the other oem control arm. I&rsquo;m going to have Natalie take me to work tomorrow, and hopefully I can get the control arm bushings pressed out so that I can get the car back together tomorrow or Tuesday evening. I also need to order new bolts for the front struts. (m12 1.75 70mm should work)</p>

OEM Bushing Update,oem-bushing-update,"<p>Today I went to a machine shop (twice as he wasn’t open the first time) to try to have the bushings pressed out of the OEM upper control arms. Unfortunately the didn’t think he was going to be able to press them out due to the way the oem bushings are shaped.</p>

<p>I ended up coming home and going back to the approach that John from BetaMotorsports suggested earlier in the day on a forum. </p>  <blockquote>   <p>1. Burn out the rubber part of the stock bushings and push the center out.     <br />2. Take the blade of your hacksaw and thread it through the bushing opening.      <br />3. Reassemble the hacksaw and cut one or two slits in the steel outer bushing shell.      <br />4. Using a chisel, carefully curl the cut corners of the steel outer shell into the center.      <br />5. At some point you should be able to push the shell out.</p> </blockquote>  <p>So tonight I came home and completed step 1 on all 4 of the bushings (I had one done yesterday). Unfortunately I don’t have a hack saw! Tried to stop by Ace Hardware on the way home, but they were closed. So I’ll head somewhere tomorrow and grab one and hopefully get through steps 2-5. I doubt I’ll have the car back on the road tomorrow night, but hopefully I can get it done Wednesday.</p>

Success! The bushings are removed from the upper control arms,success-the-bushings-are-removed-from-the-upper-control-arms,"<p>Well it just goes to show you. Having the right tool for a job is the key to getting the job done right.</p>

<p>Last night I spent some time trying to get the bushings out again, I didn’t have any luck. I then ran to Home Depot and picked up a 6” vise.</p>

<p>Tonight I mounted the vise to my work bench and got to work. It didn’t take long, with the vise in place I was able to knock out the first bushing. The 2nd and 3rd took a little work, but were much easier than the first one.</p>

<p>The 4th one was a breeze, though I think it was too easy for a reason. I may have cut a little too deep into the control arm….. bah! I may have to go ahead and order another oem replacement arm just to be safe. Fortunately the cut doesn’t go across the whole arm, but we’ll see. I would hate to think what could happen if that arm broke while I was driving down the highway.</p>

<p>Here’s a shot of the arm sans bushing, the cut is on the inside (far side)</p>

<p>I expected to see more drop out of the current settings, but I can always go lower if I want to later. Tomorrow I need to get the race tires on the car and see if I created any rubbing issues. I am also going to try my hand at aligning the car&hellip; Hopefully. We&rsquo;ll see how that goes.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s late so I&rsquo;ll save the full blog post/writeup about the suspension installation I need to write for early next week. In the mean time though here are some photos of the car/parts today</p>

I mistakenly sorted the photos in descending order instead of ascending. You really can&rsquo;t tell on the time lapse though, it just looks like another time lapse!</p>

<p>So what did I do today? Well I dropped the car a bit. I wasn&rsquo;t too happy with how little the car dropped after the work this week, so today I spent some time adjusting the suspension a bit. I&rsquo;ve never worked with coil overs or spring perches before so it took a little bit of figuring things out.</p>

<p>I ended up bringing the car down a bit. Here is the photo from yesterday</p>

<p><a title=""The 350z on the new suspension"" href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/17726343@N00/5562928957/""><img alt=""The 350z on the new suspension"" src=""http://static.flickr.com/5052/5562928957_b408b15521.jpg"" style=""border-width: 0px; border-style: solid;"" /></a></p>

<p>and what it looks like today (with the race tires on).</p>

<p><a title=""Lowered the car a bit today 350z"" href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/17726343@N00/5566339570/""><img alt=""Lowered the car a bit today 350z"" src=""http://static.flickr.com/5023/5566339570_1e92ff79ed.jpg"" style=""border-width: 0px; border-style: solid;"" /></a></p>

<p>I drove around the neighborhood a bit with the race tires on to see if I had any trouble rubbing, in the current configuration it doesn&rsquo;t look to. The wheels are 18x10 +38 Enkei RPF1s, and the tires are 305 V710s, I&rsquo;m glad there doesn&rsquo;t appear to be any rubbing issues, we&rsquo;ll see how it goes under autocross competition though.</p>

<p>After doing all the work I had to take the tires over to Charlie&rsquo;s place to put in the back of Ed&rsquo;s truck. Thankfully Ed is going to haul the wheels/tires down to San Diego for the National Tour next weekend, and the El Toro the following weekend.</p>

<p>I still didn&rsquo;t get a chance to do the alignment on the car, I&rsquo;m hoping to get it to an alignment shop over lunch Monday or Tuesday. I just want them to check the Toe on the alignment for now, I also want to see what the other specs came out as. I may try to do some adjustments in San Diego on Friday/Saturday, but we&rsquo;ll see.</p>",2011-03-28 01:07:14.000,html,,,/Blog/itemId/517/Lowering-the-suspension-in-reverse
"Alignment done, at least for the road trip",alignment-done-at-least-for-the-road-trip,"<p>So I didn’t figure I was going to have time to do the alignment on the 350z over the next couple of days, and I wasn’t sure that I really wanted to do an alignment myself after just lowering the car. I mean, I want to do it, but driving down to San Diego on Thursday isn’t the time I need to press my alignment skills.</p>

<p>So today I took the car to the local Firestone dealer to get an alignment done today. Here’s what I told them.</p>

<p>“I want to know what the specs are, and I want the toe to be within factory specifications.”</p>

<p>No problem they said, then they upsold me on the lifetime alignment. I told them, oh that won’t work for me, I’m gonna be making lots of changes, you guys won’t honor it. He assured me that they would, and even double checked with the manager. We’ll see how it works out, but I’m hoping they will honor it going forward! Really I will just want to use them here or there to verify that what I do when I make adjustments and try to align it myself.</p>

<p>Less than an hour later I got a phone call saying that the car was ready to go. Here are the specs that I came away with.</p>  <table border=""0"" cellspacing=""0"" cellpadding=""2"" width=""473""><tbody>     <tr>       <td valign=""top"" width=""133"">&nbsp;</td>        <td valign=""top"" width=""133"">Left F/R (in degrees)</td>        <td valign=""top"" width=""205"">Right F/R(in degrees)</td>     </tr>      <tr>       <td valign=""top"" width=""133"">Camber</td>        <td valign=""top"" width=""133"">-2.3/-2.4</td>        <td valign=""top"" width=""205"">-2.5/-2</td>     </tr>      <tr>       <td valign=""top"" width=""133"">Toe</td>        <td valign=""top"" width=""133"">.05/.12</td>        <td valign=""top"" width=""205"">.07/.09</td>     </tr>   </tbody></table>  <p>&#160;</p>

<p>Friday I plan to do some adjustment to the Toe, getting some toe out in front and toe in in the rear. We’ll see if I can get that adjustment squared away using my longacre toe plates.</p>

<p>If I come up with some additional settings for autocross alignment I’ll create a new blog post for the specs.</p>",2011-03-29 01:37:22.000,html,,,/Blog/itemId/518/Alignment-done-at-least-for-the-road-trip
GoPro Firmware Upgrade,gopro-firmware-upgrade,"<p>So if you read my postings a month or two ago you know I had trouble with the GoPro firmware last time around. Ended up bricking the camera and having to send it in.</p>

<p>Much better luck tonight! I got V 1.1.5 upgraded without any trouble. I wasn’t sure what the camera had on it that they sent me in exchange for my repair, so I wanted to make sure I was on the latest firmware for the trip to San Diego. I’m hoping to timelapse the drive.</p>

<p>We’ll see if the batteries (2 of them) last the trip, I doubt it, but we’ll see. I have the camera set for shooting every 5 seconds and plan to mount it facing out the windshield.</p>

San Diego National Tour Practice Day,san-diego-national-tour-practice-day,"<p>Today was a practice day at the San Diego National Tour. This morning I took part in the Evolution School advantage program, basically you get a ton of seat time in the morning before the practice course opens up for the rest of the entrants for the National Tour. My r-comps were on a truck otw to the tour, so I ran my street tires for the morning session. I also had the car set at full soft (bump/rebound), most definitely not the configuration needed, and my evo instructor Brian let me know.</p>

<p>He knew me (not to be cocky, a lot of autocrossers do because of my involvement with <a href=""http://www.SCCAForums.com"" target=""_blank"">SCCAForums.com</a> and announcing at events throughout the years), but he made the mistake of assuming I knew what I was doing <img style=""border-bottom-style: none; border-right-style: none; border-top-style: none; border-left-style: none"" class=""wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-openmouthedsmile"" alt=""Open-mouthed smile"" src=""http://www.project350z.com/Portals/4/PublishThumbnails/Windows-Live-Writer/San-Diego-National-Tour-Practice-Day_12E28/wlEmoticon-openmouthedsmile_2.png"" />. He assumed I knew about suspension setup, I corrected him, and asked for help! He was very helpful and provided me some guidance to try things out.</p>

<p>In the morning sessions on street tires (Azenis 615s, decent tires) I got down to 30.0*, not bad, but nothing near the 27.* that a SS Z06 was running. </p>

<p>I also had a horrendous knocking coming front the front end of the car, though that wasn’t new, it was happening all week. When I put the new bushings in I failed to apply any grease to them (other than when they went into the control arms).&#160; My father is here in town to watch me run at the tour, so we headed over to autozone to get some white lithium spray grease to try to help with the knocking. I thought, there was no way that it would help, but geez, it’s amazing how much quieter the car is now.</p>

<p>When the tires showed up I got them put on and adjusted the Konis a bit, then went back out and ran a few more practice runs to see how the car felt.</p>

<p>I got faster on each run, finishing with a 28.555. Still not up to snuff against that Z06, but definitely better than I had been doing in the morning.</p>

<p>I ended up going with the following settings on the Konis</p>

<p><strong>Front Double Adjustable Truechoice Coilovers     <br />Rebound:</strong> 1 full turn from soft (2.5 turns is full stiff)    <br /><strong>Bump:</strong> 6 clicks (12 or 13 clicks is full stiff)</p>

<p><strong>Rear Koni Sports (single adjustable)     <br />Rebound:</strong> 2.5 clicks (10 clicks available)</p>

<p>I’m still trying to get the time lapse video from drive down to San Diego yesterday together. I can’t get Windows Live Movie Maker working very well on my laptop. I’m hoping it finishes up here soon.</p>",2011-04-02 00:49:20.000,html,,,/Blog/itemId/520/San-Diego-National-Tour-Practice-Day
San Diego National Tour Day 1,san-diego-national-tour-day-1,"<p>I’m worn out, so this will likely not be as long as it should be, but here’s a quick summary of the day today.</p>

<p>First heat, they got an extra run/look at the course due to some unforeseen issues with the surface, the course got changed, and the event started over 1hr into the day. Good deal for them, not so much for those who were working. Fortunately I was just walking around talking on the mic.</p>

<p>I ran third heat, first run went out and the car did okay, I was sitting in 2nd place after first drivers in BSP. After all drivers went I was in 4th (final trophy spot). I was all over the rev limiter in 2nd on the run, hitting the limit MULTIPLE times MULTIPLE times on the course.</p>

<p>From there it went downhill. 2nd run I decided to shift to 3rd and left it in third for a long time. That actually played out well (I think, I’m hoping to look at the data tonight and see if it was faster), up until right before the finish slalom, in which I lost control of the car and spun out.</p>

<p>My third run started off bad, missing a turn, braking when I didn’t need to be. I shifted to third around the same place and ran downhill fast. I downshifted right before the final slalom and made it into the slalom without spinning, but I managed to take out the first two cones. I wasn’t to thrilled with the run, but my raw time was over a second faster than the first, knowing how bad I screwed up a few places I was happy with the result.</p>

<p>After day 1 I’m sitting in 7th in BSP, and more importantly in 2nd in ZSP (we’re running our own mini class of Nissan’s in BSP). I plan to catch Grant tomorrow though, look out Gman!</p>

<p>I don’t have the videos from today squared away yet, but you can watch the time lapse from the road trip on Thursday</p> <object width=""640"" height=""510""><param name=""movie"" value=""http://www.youtube.com/v/bJF5nh5_5SQ?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;hd=1""/><param name=""allowFullScreen"" value=""true""/><param name=""allowscriptaccess"" value=""always""/><embed src=""http://www.youtube.com/v/bJF5nh5_5SQ?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;hd=1"" type=""application/x-shockwave-flash"" allowscriptaccess=""always"" allowfullscreen=""true"" width=""640"" height=""510""/></object>  <p>&#160;</p>

San Diego National Tour Day 2,san-diego-national-tour-day-2,"<p>I was pretty down today. Going into the first set of runs I had a headache that didn’t seem to want to go away and I wasn’t happy with my performance the day before. I was actually sitting there thinking, why do I do this? I really was thinking, I love seeing friends and talking to everyone, but I was pretty down on the racing part of things.</p>

<p>While I was announcing first heat a number of cars were DNF’ng corner 3, all the MOD cars dnf’d their first run. I thought, what is wrong with these people, why are they dnf’ng up there? Well, on my first run I found out, as I did the same damn thing. I was flying around the top of the course, looking ahead (or so I though) and all of a sudden I realized I wasn’t anywhere close to making it where I needed to be, I slammed on the brakes then decided there was no way I was going to make it so I hit the gas and drove on. </p>

<p>My second run started off okay, but coming in to the end I clipped a cone, I knew it, wasn’t one I should of hit, but did. So I was sitting in 8th or 9th as of that run, where I started the day in 7th.</p>

<p>My 3rd run I wasn’t really happy going into, I was sitting in 3rd place in ZSP (our little Z car competition with 4 drivers). I went out and did as well as I could. I put up the lowest Z time for the day and moved into first in ZSP and 6th in BSP. Had I not had issues yesterday I truly believe I could have taken 5th for the weekend (1 out of trophies) but I still would have been 4 or 5 seconds out of first.</p>

<p>I’ll have videos up in the next couple of days, I have some photos uploading at the moment, when they are all complete they will be found at</p>

San Diego National Tour Autocross Runs,san-diego-national-tour-autocross-runs,"<p>So here we are, one day after the tour and I have all 6 of my runs squared away on video. Now to get them blogged about, in order of course.</p>

<p>Car Class: BSP   <br />Suspension Configuration    <br />Front: TrueChoice Coiliovers(bump 1 full turn, rebound 6 clicks) 650lb Springs    <br />Rear: Koni Sports (rebound 2.5 clicks) 500lb Springs on Adjustable Perchs    <br />Hotchkis Sway Bars: Front Full Stiff (Front hole of 3) Rear Medium Stiffness (Middle hole of 3)</p>

<p><strong>Day 1, Run 1 time: 56.744</strong></p>

<p>I started off with a very slick feeling car, cold tires. Over all the run was okay, but I felt like I was braking too much (only slight taps) and I should have been a lot faster. I was all over the rev limiter multiple times, I think I briefly shifted to third, but should have done it earlier and for far longer.</p>

<p><strong>Day 1, Run 2 time: 60.545</strong></p>

<p>On my second run on Saturday I went out with the idea that I wasn’t going to hit the rev limiter, I was going to shift to third at the top of the hill and run down the hill in third. This worked out well, until right before the final slalom when I was carrying too much speed and the rear of the car came out from under me. I came to a sliding stop and continued on the course to a time of 60.5</p>

<p>My third and final run, I started off and blew the corner just after the first slalom, this got me stirred up so I decided to really try and push it on this run. Well I pushed it, pushed it hard enough to hit two cones in the middle of the very last slalom. I knew I hit one, didn’t realize the second one. Would have been a decent time (compared to my other times) had I not hit those pesky cones.</p>

<p><strong>Day 2, Run 1 time: DNF</strong></p>

<p>So I was fortunate enough to announce the San Diego Tour, I was announcing first heat. On Sunday morning a number of people were DNF’ing at corner 3 on their runs. I thought, how the heck are these people dnf’ng. At one point three mod cars (the only three in the heat) DNF’d on 3 consecutive runs. Well, on my first run I figured it out. At the top of the hill right before the sharp right hand turn, there was an element you had to setup to the left of. I realized this right when I was passing by on the right. I ended up slamming the brakes but had no way to get over, so I floored it and kept going. I managed a decent time, 51 something I believe, but it really didn’t matter with the DNF</p>

Learning how to tune the suspension on a car,learning-how-to-tune-the-suspension-on-a-car,"<p>Have you ever wanted to learn how to tune the suspension on a car?</p>

<p>Well, I haven’t really wanted to know that, until recently. Now I NEED to know. I took the Evo Advantage program this past weekend at the San Diego National Tour and felt like a total newb when the instructor kept telling me to do things to the car and I had no idea what he was talking about.</p>

<p>So now the question is, how best to learn the art of suspension tuning? Well, I started off on Amazon and picked up <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0879380713/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=chrishammondc-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0879380713"">Tune to Win: The art and science of race car development and tuning</a><img style=""border-bottom-style: none !important; border-right-style: none !important; margin: 0px; border-top-style: none !important; border-left-style: none !important"" border=""0"" alt="""" src=""http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0879380713"" width=""1"" height=""1"" /> by Carroll Smith.</p>

<p>I’ve yet to crack it open, but I plan to start on it this evening. I’ll post more on the website later when I have a feeling for what it actually provides, and can talk about what I am learning (hopefully I’ll learn something!)</p>",2011-04-05 22:41:13.000,html,,,/Blog/itemId/524/Learning-how-to-tune-the-suspension-on-a-car
Listen to the El Toro ProSolo Live,listen-to-the-el-toro-prosolo-live,"<p>So today I did some testing with UStream and the FM Audio Broadcast at the El Toro ProSolo. I think I managed to come up with a way to broadcast the announce stream out on the internet (audio only) using UStream.</p>

<p>I setup a new “Channel” for the ProSolo on Ustream, we’ll see how it works out tomorrow, but if you want, give it a listen by going to (only active during competition, and if it works)</p>

SPL control arms in BSP,spl-control-arms-in-bsp,"<p>So I finally heard back from SPL Pars regarding an email I sent a few weeks ago. I emailed them to ask if they could provide me the information on what the arms are configured for in terms of the heim joints.</p>

<p>In summary of the <a href=""http://www.project350z.com/Articles/itemId/509/The-suspension-is-here-Now-to-fix-it.aspx"" target=""_blank"">previous blog post</a>, the heim joints aren’t legal in B Street Prepared (or any street prepared class in the SCCA). So these arms aren’t legal.</p>

<p>SPL finally responded with</p>  <blockquote>   <p>the rod end thread on our arms is 5/8&quot;-18 right hand, the width of the bearing w/ spacers is 1.96&quot; and bore size is 10mm.</p> </blockquote>  <p>Now the question is, can I come up with something that will work to replace those that will be legal in BSP?

Naked and famous,naked-and-famous,"<p>So the car is naked, well about as naked as it can be.</p>

<p>Saturday evening I took it to the car wash and removed all of the vinyl. I plan to put it back on, but it’ll be a while before that happens.

<p>I am going to wrap the 350z? What does that mean? I am going to take a solid Vinyl color, and wrap it around the entire painted surface of the car. Effectively changing the color of the car, and covering the paint in a protective vinyl coating.</p>

<p><strong>Why am I wrapping the car?</strong> Because I can? Or well, because I want to. I don’t know yet that I can. I’ve applied quite a bit of vinyl in my life, but never to an entire car.</p>

<p><strong>Why not have someone else wrap it? Why not have a designer wrap done? </strong>Both of those options cost money, and I really would rather spend money elsewhere on the car.

Project350z on Hiatus?,project350z-on-hiatus,"<p>So things have slowed down for the Project350z, at least for a month or two. After running quite a few events in February, March and April, I haven’t run an event since the El Toro ProSolo on 4/10.</p>

<p>I plan to run more events this year, but life has put autocross to the side for a month or two. We’re getting ready to move, so autocross has been the last thing on my mind.</p>

<p>This weekend there’s the Dual at DeAnza, last year I was hoping to run this year’s event, but due to everything going on I ended up not registering. It looks like Grant (ShamuZ) has lost his car for the event, due to losing a rear diff (He’s got an OS Giken diff as far as I know, I need to find out what happened as that is the diff I was hoping to put in my car later this year). I’ve asked Grant to see if he can get me into his entry position for the Duel, if he can I will try to run the event.</p>

<p>If it doesn’t work out, so be it, but I think it would be cool to run. The next few weeks are going to be extremely busy, so an autocross before all of that would be a good release!</p>",2011-05-11 00:51:44.000,html,,,/Blog/itemId/532/Project350z-on-Hiatus
Autocross 350z Modifications List,autocross-350z-modifications-list,"<p>I realized recently that I didn&rsquo;t have an ongoing list of modifications for the 350z. So I figured I should create one. The idea is that this will be continually updated, with the list of current parts.

"2011 SCCA Solo Nationals, should I stay or should I go?",2011-scca-solo-nationals-should-i-stay-or-should-i-go,"<p>So here we are, at the end of May 2011, and it’s time to figure out if I’m going to the 2011 Tire Rack SCCA Solo National Championships in late August.</p>

<p>Originally I was planning on taking the 350z, but lately I’ve been thinking that I probably won’t/can’t/shouldn’t due to a number of factors, mainly budget, but time, and family. With a new baby, taking off to Lincoln Nebraska for a week (or more) is a rather costly affair. I can’t exactly put Natalie and the baby in the 350z and make the drive, and making the drive with the 350z, towing a trailer for tires, and having Natalie and the baby drive in the CX-7 isn’t ideal either.</p>

<p>So I have a couple of options. </ul>
<p>   <li>Don’t go (least expensive option, also least fun) </li>    <li>Drive myself in the 350z, have Natalie and baby fly out (requires airline ticket, and rental car) </li>    <li>Drive myself in the 350z and have Natalie and baby stay home </li>    <li>Fly to Lincoln and codrive with someone else </li> </ul>
<p>What to do, what to do?</p>",2011-05-31 03:06:45.000,html,,,/Blog/itemId/535/2011-SCCA-Solo-Nationals-should-I-stay-or-should
"Let there be sound, and I&rsquo;m going to Nationals (not in the 350z)",let-there-be-sound-and-im-going-to-nationals-not-in-the-350z,"<p>So I finally had it with listening to my Motorola Droid (Google Music and Pandora) for my commute. Why don’t I have a stereo? Well back in February I ripped it all out. Not exactly the best choice, but hey, I was in the hear of the moment thinking I was prepping the car for a fully competitive 2011 season. That has changed, (more on that later).</p>

<p>A couple of weeks ago I told the subwoofer and amplifier for the car, I wasn’t interested in putting all of that weight back in anyways. So tonight after work I put the speakers back in the door (with some cutting and soldering on the OEM wiring due to not having adapters for it.</p>

<p>I managed to get everything back into the front of the car, including the crossovers, and the head unit. I wasn’t able to get the radio working, as it doesn’t seem to see that the Antenna is hooked up, so I’ll have to track that down. I also didn’t get the rear speakers in, simply due to time/darkness, I’ll get those later this week.</p>

<p>So, why am I not building the car fully for 2011? Well honestly, budget. I need to put quite a bit more money into the car, and it’s already the middle of June. Where did time go? So, without the budget to fully prep the car, I’m going to drive something else at the 2011 Solo Nationals.</p>

<p>I’ll be driving Dave Whitworth’s Mustang in EM at Nationals. Dave and I have been friends for 11 years now, he was my first instructor when I started autocrossing, and while I surpassed him in autocross skills long ago<img style=""border-bottom-style: none; border-left-style: none; border-top-style: none; border-right-style: none"" class=""wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-devil"" alt=""Devil"" src=""http://www.project350z.com/Portals/4/PublishThumbnails/Windows-Live-Writer/Let-there-be-sound-and-Im-going-to-Natio_12F6A/wlEmoticon-devil_2.png"" />, he’s still a friend of mine <img style=""border-bottom-style: none; border-left-style: none; border-top-style: none; border-right-style: none"" class=""wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-openmouthedsmile"" alt=""Open-mouthed smile"" src=""http://www.project350z.com/Portals/4/PublishThumbnails/Windows-Live-Writer/Let-there-be-sound-and-Im-going-to-Natio_12F6A/wlEmoticon-openmouthedsmile_2.png"" /></p> <iframe height=""349"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/Y6e_nRbu-KY"" frameborder=""0"" width=""425"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen""></iframe>  <p>&#160;</p>

<p>I'll fly into Lincoln, though I'm not sure when yet, and likely be there all week. I've offered to announce at the ProSolo Finale, though I haven't heard if anyone is interested in taking me up on that offer or not. </p>

<p>I am hoping that for 2012 I can get the 350z sorted out and ready for Nationals. Though, I really don’t like that I now live 26 hours from Nationals. Living in St. Louis and being a 5 hour drive from it (when it was in Topeka) definitely spoiled me!</p>",2011-06-15 00:58:01.000,html,,,/Blog/itemId/537/Let-there-be-sound-and-Im-going-to-Nationals-no
Old Project Z posts,old-project-z-posts,"<p>I’ve been doing some work on SOLO2.ORG the past two evenings, working on restoring a bunch of my old blog posts from over there from the early days of the site. There was a lot of content that went missing over the various conversions of the site the past 4-5 years.</p>

<p>I managed to bring a number of the posts back, and found a lot of old posts about my original 2003 350z (the current one I have is a 2004), at which point in time I just called it Project Z (rather than Project350z).</p>

"Autocrossing this sunday in Marina, CA",autocrossing-this-sunday-in-marina-ca,"<p>Alright, it’s time to get back into the swing of things. The 2011 TireRack SCCA Solo Nationals are in two months, I need to try to get as much seat time as I can between now and then!</p>

<p>This weekend the <a href=""http://www.americanauto-x.com/"" target=""_blank"">AmericanAuto-x</a> Series is going on at Marina. I’ve yet to hit an AAS event, so I am looking forward to it. It will have been nearly three months since my last event, so I’m sure I’ll be plenty rusty. I am only going to hit the Sunday event, not ready to do both Saturday and Sunday, as I have some work to do on the car, and also some work to do around the house on Saturday.</p>

<p>If you’re going to be at Marina this weekend, be sure to come up and say hello.</p>",2011-06-30 02:16:05.000,html,,,/Blog/itemId/539/Autocrossing-this-sunday-in-Marina-CA
The missing helmet! Natalie found it!,the-missing-helmet-natalie-found-it,"<p>Over a year ago I realized that my Bell Helmet was missing. Somewhere on the move from Colorado to California it went off into its own world.</p>

<p>I was sure I had it with me when I came in March 2010, and must have left it in a hotel while I was shifting around hotels for a few weeks while looking for a place to live. I went through box after box after box when we moved all our stuff from Colorado to CA in April, but no matter where I dug I couldn’t find it.</p>

<p>Then last month we moved again, this time only 20 miles or so away, but I figured I would find the helmet if it were still around during that move. I was wrong. I found nothing.</p>

<p>Until today, Natalie was going through boxes of pictures with her mother (visiting for the weekend) and in one of the boxes labeled Picture Frames, she found the helmet!</p>

<p><a title=""Day 26 of #flickr365 #autocross #helmet by chrishammond, on Flickr"" href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/5390956023/""><img alt=""Day 26 of #flickr365 #autocross #helmet"" align=""right"" src=""http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5296/5390956023_41ce9910af_m.jpg"" width=""179"" height=""240"" /></a>Earlier this year I purchased a new helmet (pictured) getting ready for the 2011 autocross season, while I like the helmet, it wasn’t my Bell, which I always hoped would return.</p>

<p>I’ll have to take a picture of the Bell later this weekend, I can’t find one digging through old photos, but I did come across some photos from the day I picked up my 2003 350z.</p>

<p>Here’s a photo of the 350z, and the 1999 Z-28 Camaro I traded in when I purchased it.</p> <a title=""My 350z and my Camaro by chrishammond, on Flickr"" href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/5893276184/""><img alt=""My 350z and my Camaro"" src=""http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5064/5893276184_d938cdcd93_m.jpg"" width=""240"" height=""180"" /></a>",2011-07-02 19:07:16.000,html,,,/Blog/itemId/540/The-missing-helmet-Natalie-found-it
Back in the saddle again,back-in-the-saddle-again,"<p>This morning I took off from our house around 6:10am and headed south on Highway 1. I was on the road to Marina, CA. The trip was nice and uneventful, traffic was great, but I’m sure that had to do with the fact that it was so early on a Sunday morning of a three day weekend.</p>

<p>I got out to the event, registered, and signed up for my work assignment, then began the dirty work. Changing the tires on the car. It’s a fairly painless job, though I really drag it out most times, I could probably get it done in under 5 minutes, but typically it takes me 15-20 as I fart around doing it.</p>

<p>I worked first heat, I was doing the timer cards, wow, I can’t tell you the last time I had to write times down instead of them going into a computer <img style=""border-bottom-style: none; border-left-style: none; border-top-style: none; border-right-style: none"" class=""wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-openmouthedsmile"" alt=""Open-mouthed smile"" src=""http://www.project350z.com/Portals/4/PublishThumbnails/Windows-Live-Writer/Back-in-the-saddle-again_14998/wlEmoticon-openmouthedsmile_2.png"" /> I little antiquated, but the process over all worked out. Computers can definitely make things more efficient, but also add a level of overhead that most clubs don’t want to deal with.</p>

<p>The weather at Marina was awesome today, I was half prepared to freeze my ass off because Ed Runnion warned me last night to bring a jacket. I must admit, a jacket, or pants, were not needed today! A t-shirt and shorts were plenty.</p>

<p>I ran in the second heat, my first autox runs since the El Toro ProSolo in April. I was definitely rusty. I also seemed to have forgotten how badly this car needs a differential. If anyone from OS Giken is out there and interested in trading some sponsorship for product let me know, I’m definitely open to opportunities <img style=""border-bottom-style: none; border-left-style: none; border-top-style: none; border-right-style: none"" class=""wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-openmouthedsmile"" alt=""Open-mouthed smile"" src=""http://www.project350z.com/Portals/4/PublishThumbnails/Windows-Live-Writer/Back-in-the-saddle-again_14998/wlEmoticon-openmouthedsmile_2.png"" /></p>

<p>My runs for the most part improved each time today, until the last I believe. I don’t know where my times were compared to much of the rest of the class, but I know I was probably 1.5+ seconds off where I should have been. The ASP cars I saw were running low 41s, while I was in the low 43s. The Tsang brothers (FSP) were in the high 42s, so I definitely need to get this car sorted out and my driving improved!</p>

<p>I didn’t stick around the site after my runs, changed tires and headed out so that I could get home. I think I found the downfall of living in Half Moon Bay. It took me just under 2 hours to get to Marina this morning, and over 3 hours to get home due to all the holiday/beach traffic!</p>

Watching The Car Show,watching-the-car-show,"<p>So I got home from work this evening, spent some time with the baby this evening, and now I am watching The Car Show (@<a href=""http://twitter.com/carshow"" target=""_blank"">carshow</a>), a new series on Speed, though I am watching it on Hulu.</p>

<p>If you’re a car guy, you should check it out.</p>

<p>To be honest though, I’m not sure it is any better, or even as good, as Top Gear USA. Which is ironic, because Adam Carolla was originally on the pilot for Top Gear USA if I recall correctly.</p>

<p>What do you think of the show?</p>",2011-07-15 00:56:55.000,html,,,/Blog/itemId/543/Watching-The-Car-Show
Installing the 350z Trailer Hitch,installing-the-350z-trailer-hitch,"<p>So the time finally came, or I finally got around to it, the hitch is now on our 2004 Nissan 350z.</p>

<p>The hitch is a <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BROASA?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=chrishammondc-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B000BROASA"" target=""_blank"">Curt Hitch for the 350z, available via Amazon</a>. I purchased it quite a while ago, but haven’t taken the time to get the car apart and install it. Today that all changed.</p>

<p>To get the hitch on the car, you first have to remove the rear bumper fascia from the car, that’s fairly simple to do, remove the rear tail lights, remove 6 or so screws, 4 clips, and pull. The 350z Service Manual is helpful for this.</p>

<p>After that you have to go ahead and drill some holes in the bumper. The hitch itself uses 4 bolts, but the instructions call for cutting a fifth hole, to access to make fishing in the bolts and washer plates.</p>

<p>We spent quite a bit of time trying to avoid cutting the access hole, trust me, just cut it, don’t go through the pain of trying to make it work without. I also recommend that you get a long magnetic puller tool, something that extends like an old conference room pointer, with a magnet on the end, it will make things easier to access within the aluminum bumper of the 350z.</p>

<p>Other helpful steps, get a couple of extra washers, there is no way, in my opinion, that the Curt Hitch can work with the two washers included, you need at least 4 (we got 6 extra, used 4 total).</p>

<p>Part of the biggest pain in doing the installation of the Hitch were the two clips that hold the bumper fascia on just outside/below the tail lights. They are hard to access due to the layout of the car, I was able to finally get them off using an 8mm wrench, though it took a lot of cursing. Installation of these was even worse, here’s my advise. Take the clips out of the body of the car, put them onto the fascia, then put them back into the car when the bumper goes back on. Be careful not to break them.</p>

<p>So the hitch is on the car, though I don’t plan to use it for a good couple of weeks at least. I don’t have a trailer yet, it will likely just be used so that I can take a bike to/from work so I can ride at lunch.</p>

<p>Here is a during, and after photo, and stay tuned for the time lapse video of the process later on.</p>

Mounting a video camera behind your car,mounting-a-video-camera-behind-your-car,"<p>Today was the first event in the San Francisco Region&rsquo;s slush series. I decided to head out and try to dust some of the rust off, and last night decided to build a camera mount for the car. After seeing the <a href=""http://www.tkqlhce.com/click-5311515-10456937?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fstyle%2FCJ%2F794062%3Fpartner%3Daff_cj%26mr%3AtrackingCode%3D5DECBDAC-FA10-DF11-BAE3-0019B9C043EB%26mr%3AreferralID%3DNA&amp;cjsku=794062"" target=""_blank"">GoPro</a> HD Hero2 launch video, I decided it was time to try to start getting more interesting video.</p>

<p>Earlier this week I attempted to do something interesting with video on my bicycle for <a href=""http://www.bicycletips.com"">www.bicycletips.com</a> but the video turned out pretty bad.</p>

<p>For the 350z I wanted to try to get the camera up and behind the car. Not just on top of the car, but a couple feet back and above the car. So I got the building, really I didn&rsquo;t build much, just assembled some parts that I had, and that I picked up from the local Ace Hardware store here in Half Moon Bay.</p>

<p>This is the end result</p>

<p>I won&rsquo;t bother posting all the parts of what this contains, not yet, as it is just V1, and you will see from the video below that it actually doesn&rsquo;t work that well.</p>

<p>[YouTube:StTNNow9F74]</p>

<p>That is video of my 4th run today. I had cone issues all day long, and the fourth run was no exception, but that&rsquo;s not the real focus of this post, the video.</p>

<p>The video, blah, it really didn&rsquo;t turn out well. The camera has two major flaws. One the way I mounted it into the extension wasn&rsquo;t secure enough, so it had slight movement, which I think is the majority of the noise you hear, though some of that could actually be from the safety strap that I had all this tied to the car with.</p>

<p>The other flaw was the amount of movement on the camera/poll itself. I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s a good way to get rid of that without doing some sort of guide cable setup, which I hope to try out in the next couple of weeks.</p>

<p>I do like the angle that the view that the video shows, makes for an interesting angle for sure.</p>

<p>What do you think? Besides the shakyness and the bad audio, what do you think of the setup?</p>",2011-10-31 00:46:54.000,html,,,/Blog/itemId/549/Mounting-a-video-camera-behind-your-car
For Sale (4) 18x10&quot; +38 Enkei RPF1 w/ 710s,for-sale-4-18x10&quot;-38-enkei-rpf1-w/-710s,"<p>Asking <b>$1600</b> local (delivery extra, I have small vehicles so transport is a pain). Currently located in Half Moon Bay, California, just south of San Francisco.</p>

<p>It looks like 2012 will be a no go for me (no budget to get the car where it needs to be) so I am going to part ways with my beautiful 18x10&quot; +38 Enkei RPF1s. The wheels currently have 18&quot; 305 Kumho 710s mounted, plenty of tread left, though not competitive nationally, great for local/regional events.</p>

<p>These were mounted on my 2004 Nissan 350z, 1/4 prepped for BSP. Rears fit without any spacers, front used a 10mm spacer. If you are interested in buying the car, let me know, it is not currently up for sale, but could be.</p>

<p>Currently offering local (stored in Half Moon Bay) with hopes of selling and not having to deal with shipping.</p>

<p>I purchased this combo about a year ago, pretty much as they sit, ran them for the year, never have had them off or flipped. Wheels are painted black on the outside, don't know if that was done by the PO or someone else.</p>

<p>Wheels are in okay shape, couple nicks here or there, no curb rash, see pictures (larger versions on Flickr). These are autocross wheels/tires and have been treated as such. After looking at the pics, I probably should have at least washed them <img border=""0"" alt=""Wink"" src=""http://www.baautox.com/forum/images/smiley_icons/icon_wink.gif"" /></p>

Mike Lane over on the east coast requested the control arms/custom bushings that I have on the car, so he sent me his original OEM set. A couple of months ago I actually tried to remove the arms on my car so I could lube them up and try to get rid of some of the excess noise in the car, but I wasn’t able to. One of the nuts on the upper strut mount was stuck and no matter what I tried I wasn’t able to get the nut removed.</p>

<p>I picked up some tools from the local Ace Hardware in Half Moon Bay to get that pesky nut off, and this morning when I got started, things didn’t go well. I managed to&#160; break an extension I was trying to use, then I managed to break the bolt extractor as well! I was not a happy camper, though I decided to try one more thing, a better quality extension and turning it by hand. After that nut was removed replacing the control arms was nice and easy.<img style=""display: inline; float: right"" align=""right"" src=""http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7005/6656782531_814820e325_m.jpg"" /></p>      <p>So the first parts of the car are back to stock, I’m shipping out Mike’s new control arms early next week, and hopefully they will see some autocross action soon!</p>",2012-01-08 00:04:51.000,html,,,/Blog/itemId/551/Undoing-the-BSP-350z

Did you spend two days under your car? I basically did, well more like 1 day, but it was broken up over an afternoon/evening and then the following morning after I ran to get a new “nut” that I needed to finish things up.</p>

<p>Why was I under the 350z? Well, removing the fun parts of course. I planned to remove the front and rear Hotchkis sway bars, along with the TrueChoice Phase 4 Konis (front) and the off the shelf Koni Sports (rear) along with springs/perches. Though in order to deal with the rear sway bar I also ended up pulling the Injen Super SES exhaust system off the car as well and put the OEM exhaust back on.</p>

I’ve been threatening it for a while now, but with the 2015 Solo National Championships going on this week, and a few other life things figured out, it is time to make the 2016 autocross season happen!</p>
<p>So a few details. I’m once again looking at early 350z’s, this time around I’m not looking for a daily driver, this next car will be built specifically for autocross and a fun weekend toy, with some daily driving here and there (thankful I have a short commute). I am looking for the perfect car, how do you define that? Well, in an ideal world the perfect 350z for me would be </p> <ul> <li><strong>Year</strong>: 2003, 2004, 2005  <li><strong>Model</strong>: Base, Enthusiast. Preference would be Base, the lightest of the 350z’s.  <li><strong>Mileage</strong>: &lt;100k, though I think this is going to be the one I have to be the most flexible on.  <li><strong>Transmission</strong>: Manual (not optional)  <li><strong>Mods</strong>: None</li></ul> <h2>Why 2003, 2004, 2005? </h2> <p>The primary reason is the price, I am looking to get something cheap, I would like to spend between $5k and $7k. The other reason is that the weight of the later cars went up a bit as safety equipment was added (standard side curtain airbags, etc). I also had both a 2003 and 2004 before, so some of the motivation is nostalgia.</p> <h2>Why a Base or Enthusiast Model?</h2> <p>The Base and Enthusiast models are the lightest of the models. The Enthusiast model has Traction Control, HID Headlights, and a Limited Slip Differential (LSD), options that the BASE model doesn’t have. Both of my previous cars were Enthusiasts, though my preference this time around would be a base model. While I like the HID headlamps, I definitely don’t need them on a primarily autocrossed car, and the TCS on the prior to cars was turned off every time I started the car up, so I would prefer not to have it this time around. As for the LSD, the one provided in the 350zs was a horrible device, so I would be replacing it with something better this time around. So at this time, a BASE model is my preferred option.</p> <h2>Mods?</h2> <p>You might think, Chris, if you’re going to prep the car for autocross, why do you want one without mods? A couple of reasons:</p> <ol> <li>An unmodded car, is more likely (but not always) to be unmolested, not as abused  <li>Mods in Autocross change classes on a car, I want to be able to control where the car goes, without having to take it completely apart to see if there are mods I don’t know about and would be illegal in whichever class I choose to build the car for.</li></ol> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h2>2005 Base Model 350z</h2> <p>I looked at a 2005 Base model 350z today, here are my comments on that car. If the owner of that car happens to stumble on this, please take no offense, this is just my analysis of the car for the purposes of assisting anyone else looking to purchase a 350z for autocross purposes. The car I looked at today was silver, pretty obviously repainted at some point as the front end looked pretty good for a car with 150k miles on it. That being said there were plenty of issues to be found with the car, here’s a quick rundown, along with my thoughts on each. From the original post, the owner said the car was stock, but inspection of the pictures on Craigslist showed otherwise. Initially I noticed that the tail lights had been replaced, the intake replaced, and the wheels replaced, further inspection of the car found other things as well.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Bumper cover</strong> – this car had obviously had some front end damage, nothing that I could see in the frame, but the bumper cover was literally ripped/separated from the top right portion of the car.  <li><strong>Plastic undertray </strong>– the undertray under the motor/front end was no where to be found. I know you can purchase this, as I replaced the one on my first 350z, but replacing the one on this car might have been an issue as the tabs where most of the screws would go into on the bumper cover were broken or missing.  <li><strong>CAI</strong> – this car had some form of a cold air induction system, though I couldn’t find a brand on it. The filter attached to it was caked in dirt and grease.  <li><strong>Plenum spacer</strong> – As I found on my 2004 350z after purchasing it, this car appeared to have a spacer of some sort installed as well.  <li><strong>Driver’s seat</strong> – As common on the 350zs, the side bolster on this car was worn through to the foam. Honestly this isn’t a huge deal as I would be replacing the seat(s) with a more race oriented seat anyways.  <li><strong>Driver’s side carpet</strong> – the driver’s side carpet was worn through, and the owner had some big bulky rubber floor mat in there to cover it up. The base models I believe originally didn’t come with floor mats, it is a shame someone didn’t put one in this car early on to prevent this.  <li><strong>Dirt everywhere, so much dirt</strong>  <li><strong>TPS Monitors and tires</strong> – the car was equipped with 18” Performance wheels, with 225 tires on them. There were no TPS sensors, the tires were far too narrow on the wheels, plus they would need to be replaced, they were crap tires.  <li><strong>Spare tire</strong> – the spare was still in the car, though it was not attached to the car as it should have been, the screw for that was nowhere to be found, and the jack/tools to change the spare were either missing, or misplaced.  <li><strong>Spare tire well</strong> – The inside of the spare tire well on this car had either oil, or water in it. He claimed it was spilled oil, it sure felt like water. Either way, there is nothing that should be in there besides a spare tire, how does water get in there?</li></ul> <h2>The biggest deal</h2> <p>So after listing off all the things wrong with the car, I do keep in mind that it is a 10 year old car, with 150k miles on it. I gladly would have purchased the car and turned it into an autocross beast, but we simply were too far off on the price. The car itself according to KBB and Edmunds is worth at most $5500, which is what I told him I would be willing to pay in cash. He wanted $8750 as he says he has a loan on it (he posted it again on Craigslist after I left at $8500). Honestly after writing this up, if he were to reach back out to me, I would probably drop my offer a bit, Edmunds says dealer retail on the car is like $4k. </p> <h2>What comes next?</h2> <p>At this point I don’t know when I will purchase my next 350z. I hope to find something this fall, we have one more <a href=""http://www.gatewayautox.com/"">Gateway Autocross Association</a> event later this year, I would love to run my own car for that, but that might not be possible.</p>",2015-09-06 20:52:21.000,html,,,/Blog/itemId/556/Project350z-V3-coming-soon

<p>Earlier this week, Dave from SoloPerformance.com and I headed down to Chattanooga to pick up Project350z V3. A 2003 Nissan 350z Touring model, with 145k miles on the clock. The car was purchased from a fellow autocrosser, and is primarily prepped for SCCA&rsquo;s STU class.</p>

<p>The car has a couple of issues, the first one I need to address is that the horn doesn&rsquo;t work. After digging into it, I found it is because it simply isn&rsquo;t wired up, a previous owner had replaced the stock wheel, and when the owner I purchased it from got it, he put the original stock wheel back on. The wiring was jacked at this point, and the cruise control and horn no longer connect/work. I&rsquo;ve already placed an order for some parts to hopefully get those two items addressed this coming week so I can get it out for Missouri inspection so I can get it tagged.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll be doing some modifications over the winter to get it in line with the STU rules, and hopefully fully prepped to give it a competitive chance for 2016.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This Sunday (11/8) I'll have the car out and running at the final <a href=""http://www.gatewayautox.com"">Gateway Autocross Association</a> event for 2015, see you out there!</p>

<p>Stay tuned as I dig into the car and get to actively blogging more as I get the work done on the car.</p>",2015-11-07 00:48:18.000,html,,,/Blog/itemId/558/Introducing-Project350z-V3

The weather was beautiful, I spent most of Saturday afternoon performing the first two steps, washing and clay bar&rsquo;ng the car. The car was pretty clean, but there were some decent cone marks/residue on the side skirts from the previous owner, most of the time spent with the clay bar was there, though there were various other locations on the car that needed attention as well.</p>  <h2>Clay Bar basics</h2>  <p>If you&rsquo;ve never taken a clay bar to the paint on your car, here&rsquo;s a quick primer. A clay bar is used to clean up particulates in paint and to remove wax, and if you autocross, it is rather useful for cleaning up cone marks. The first thing you need to do before using the bar is to Wash the car. Drying the car isn&rsquo;t really necessary as you will be washing it again after you finish with the bar. Once you&rsquo;ve watched the car, you can use a lubricant (detailer mist/spray) to work the clay bar over small sections of the car. You will notice that as you run the bar over the car you will feel the paint smooth out, this happens when the bar picks up the crap from the paint. Be careful not to drop the clay bar on the ground, if you do this it will be covered in grit and crap that you definitely don&rsquo;t want to rub back into the paint of the car.</p>

<p>Once you&rsquo;ve finished one spot, move on to the next. I ended up not using detailer spray yesterday and just used soapy water, then rinsed that water/soap off with hose every few minutes. If you find trouble spots, scratches, imperfections, it is worth trying to run the clay bar over these spots, sometimes it takes 5-10 minutes of work, but often times it will clean up with enough effort, this is especially true of cone marks on the bottom portion of side skirts.</p>

<p>After finishing with the clay bar you&rsquo;re going to want to wash your vehicle again to get any residue that remains from the clay bar and the detailer spray off the car. I dried the car with a California car squeegee, and then my shammy. I took the blower and tried to get any remaining water out of the seams of the car and then parked it in the garage for a couple of hours to let it fully dry. Last night I then applied a coat of polish before turning in for the night. This morning I woke up early and put a coat of wax on the car, and decided it was time to clean the headlights up.</p>  <h2>Cleaning 350z Headlights</h2>  <p>The headlights on my car were in two different states, the passenger side headlight has some stress cracks, but the surface plastic only had a very faint fog to it. I was able to clean this fog off with a simple headlight restoration polish that I&rsquo;ve had for a few years, it was simple, rub it on, wipe it off, good as new (minus the cracks). </p>

<p>The driver&rsquo;s side headlight however was not in near as nice a shape, it appeared to have over spray on it, as well as scuffs likely from a sanding process when the car was painted at some point. The headlight polish I used on the passenger side, didn&rsquo;t do a lick of good on the driver&rsquo;s side. For this I chose to go with &ldquo;Meguiar's G2000 Perfect Clarity Two Step Headlight Restoration Kit&rdquo;, this kit comes with an abrasive pad (2x), a rubbing compound (step 1), and a clear coat spray (step 2).</p>

<p>Step 1) Don&rsquo;t be afraid here, but you are going to scratch the crap out of your headlight lens, step 2 will make this better. I had to spend a good 15-20 minutes working on the driver&rsquo;s side lens due to the scuffing and fogging on the plastic. The abrasive pad and the polishing compound should be used in one direction, not in a swirling motion. I wiped the product off every couple of minutes to try to check my progress, when you are done with this you will need to use a wet rag to wipe the residue off. One thing I did for this, due to the abrasive nature of the product, I taped over the paint with blue painters tape, to protect the paint around the headlamp from scratches. When I do this again on another vehicle, I would actually use tape and newspaper to cover a larger area (due to step 2).</p>

<p>Step 2) The instructions for the product don&rsquo;t tell you much about this, but Step 2 is a spray can of clear coat that will restore the gloss and shine to your headlamps. Be sure to tape off the area around the lamp if you haven&rsquo;t done this already for Step 1. Basically you spray the clear coat on in two separate applications, waiting 3-5 minutes for the first coat to dry.</p>

<p>I must admit, I was not thrilled about scratching up the headlights even more to use this kit, but the end results was most definitely worth it!</p>

<p>The car failed Missouri safety and emissions testing today. When I pulled out of the driveway this morning something happened up front, on the brakes, one of the wheels locked up, ""SLIP"" and ""VDC"" lights came on and wouldn't shut off. Restarted the car, got out, checked for anything noticeable and drove down the road to the gas station. At the station I decided to plug the OBDII scanner in and sure enough, it was throwing an ABS code.</p>

<p>Told it to clear all codes to see if that would stay off, but after driving a short time the two lights came back on. Crap.</p>

<p>Went to the local Dobbs, and put it in for testing. They said the ABS light wouldn't be a concern for the testing, and the horn I wired up to a button was sufficient.</p>

<p>What I forgot was the tires need to have decent tread for the safety inspection, over the weekend I threw the Hankook RS3s on as one of the RE-71s was flat, that was a mistake. The RS3s have hardly any tread, and failed inspection. I'll throw the RE71s back on tomorrow night and just watch the one that is leaking air (this Dobbs plugged a whole in it 2 weeks ago).</p>

<p>The noise this morning in the driveway was likely the left front wheel bearing, throwing the ABS off. That also failed inspection, so I replaced the wheel bearing tonight.</p>

<p>Also failed for a couple of exhaust issues, 3 of the 6 (8?) gaskets on the exhaust were leaking, so I replaced them with 3 gaskets I was able to obtain from Autozone. Not perfect fits, but hopefully close enough, added some high temp sealant in there as well to try to fix the leaks there. There's also a hole in the exhaust pipe on the passenger side, where it dips down lower than the driver's side, it has apparently scraped over many a speed bump and torn through. I put some sealant in there tonight, and will put some exhaust repair tape over it tomorrow night (after the sealant sets) to see if I can close that up for the inspection. This winter that damn exhaust is coming off in favor of something lighter.</p>

<p>Finally, they couldn't even do the emissions testing, because me resetting the codes to try to fix the ABS also cleared all the emissions sensors, so I have to drive the car for a while (how far?) after I get all the exhaust repairs done to try and get the sensors enough mileage to run through their data and hopefully be able to get the car back in for inspection on Friday morning.</p>

<p>Follow up to the failed emissions and safety test earlier this week.&nbsp; Last night I got under the car again and checked for leaks, found that one of the gaskets I hadn't touched was leaking, so I tried to cover that up with some exhaust tape.</p>

<p>I also wrapped some of the tape around the hole in the pipe, then let the car run for 20 minutes at idle to try to get it to set in.</p>

<p>I swapped the wheels on the car to run the tires with good tread on them, and headed off to Washington Missouri to put some miles on the car to try to get the computer set with proper responses for the emissions code tests.</p>

<p>While in Washington Missouri I managed to draft the exhaust over two bumps, figuring out how the hole got in the pipe to begin with (this was the first time I had bottomed out with it).</p>

<p>I stopped in at the local Wal-Mart (the only thing open at 10pm in Washington, MO) to see if I could get any more exhaust tape, figuring I had torn the existing tape. Low and behold, WM didn't have anything I could use, so I headed back out to the parking lot, started up the car and reached underneath to see if it was leaking. Fortunately it didn't appear to be dumping any exhaust out from where it was leaking, so I thought I was okay.</p>

<p>I figured out that my SLIP light that keeps coming on is not related to my wheel bearing, it must be that I mistakenly tore the clock spring when I was trying to fix the horn/airbag earlier this week. So that'll likely mean that I need to replace that again, but we'll deal with that down the road, I don't need it for the inspections.</p>

<p>This morning I took the car back to Dobbs to get the safety and emissions inspections done. Good news is that the car passed the emissions check! The bad news is that apparently exhaust repairs need to be welds, not tape...</p>

<p>So, next weekend I'll head down to Solo Performance Specialties​ and weld something onto the pipe to close up the exhaust.</p>

<p>This winter I will replace the exhaust entirely, but for now I just need to pass the darn safety inspection.</p>",2015-11-21 00:14:28.000,html,,,/Blog/itemId/561/Missouri-Safety-inspection-exhaust-hole-fail

<p>When I picked up the 350z in Chattanooga back in November, I figured out that the radio wasn&rsquo;t great, the sound was weak, and it didn&rsquo;t appear to pick up any FM signals whatsoever. Over the Xmas weekend I decided it was time to rip into the car to remove the stock Bose amp and subwoofer (behind the driver&rsquo;s seat) as well as try to tack down why the FM reception was non-existent.</p>

<p>The first step was to get into the subwoofer location behind the driver&rsquo;s seat, a quick screw driver inserted into the panelling to pop the cover off. pry and then pull it off. Once I removed the cover, I quickly found that the stock Bose setup had already been removed, I figured that might be the case, but wasn&rsquo;t 100% sure until we pulled the cover off. While in there I took the time to clean up some of the stray wiring that was in there, some exposed wires, and some live power wires that simply had electrical tape wrapped around them. </p>

<p>After working on the (lack there of) Sub, it was time to rip into the dashboard. I&rsquo;ve done it so many times on my prior 350zs that it is straightforward and fairly painless to do. The one thing that gave me trouble was disconnecting the wiring harness from the center console where the harness powers the hazard, and seat warmer switches. I ended up pulling the panel up and off of the emergency brake in order to get to the plug for the wiring.</p>

<p>Once I pulled the plastic for the console out of place I dug in behind the stereo itself. First thing I checked was to see if the antenna wiring was plugged into the head unit, unfortunatly it was, so that wasn&rsquo;t going to be an easy fix! I tracked down some wires from the stereo by pulling down the manual from the Pioneer website.One thing I did find was there is the &ldquo;mic&rdquo; for the handsfree bluetooth setup was plugged into the &ldquo;wired remote&rdquo; port on the back of the head unit. I unplugged that, but unfortunately couldn&rsquo;t plug it into the proper MIC input as the jack was the wrong size. I plugged the mic back into the W/R port and started playing around with the headunit to see if I could get any stations tuned.</p>

<p>While digging in the center console compartment I found a wireless remote for the stereo, thinking that might work with &ldquo;options&rdquo; better than the touch screen I try to start using that, with no success. I checked the battery in the remote, and found it was a CR2016, but the remote said it took a CR2025, so I grabbed a spare and popped that in place. Ends up, that didn&rsquo;t work either, no matter what I tried I couldn&rsquo;t get the remote to work. Until I once again unplugged the mic from the &ldquo;wired remote&rdquo; port, one I did that the remote started working properly. So apparently whomever installed this radio, the wiring was done incorrectly on the MIC, and that was causing problems.</p>

<p>I went ahead and left the MIC unplugged and put everything back together in the car. I immediately tried to tune FM, and found that I could actually tune to a specific station, where previously I was only able to scan, and with the lack of signal previously, the scan would continue until manually stopped by switching input sources. I still wasn&rsquo;t able to get a clear tune on a station, but when I pulled the car out of the garage to reposition where it was parked, I did find that it started to get a signal to a local radio station here. </p>

<p>So it looks like the ultimately problem with the radio may just have been the miswired Mic, we&rsquo;ll see, next time I drive the car, how things play out. It might be a while though before I get back out in the Z, it has turned cold here in Missouri and I don&rsquo;t plan to drive the car too much in below freezing temps, due to the abuse on the tires.</p>

<p>After popping the tire off the wheel we quickly found that the wheel had a repair attempted both inside and outside of the wheel, it actually looked like someone had taken JB Weld to it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The repairs had cracked through, and the wheel was out of round, first we rolled it on the floor to see, then put it on the balancer, and it definitely was out of whack. Instead of even trying to repair the wheel I ordered another one from NLMotoring, it was $165 shipped, so it just made sense to order a new one than to worry about another repair weakening the wheel even further and constantly working about it leaking in the future. </p>
<p>These wheels aren’t what I would choose if money weren’t an option, but money is always a factor in racing, and these are the wheels that came with the car, so they will have to do until I get some <a href=""http://www.soloperformance.com/CCW-Wheels_c_747.html"" target=""_blank"">CCW Wheels from SPS</a>.</p>

"How to drop 40lbs from your 2003 350z, new seats!",how-to-drop-40lbs-from-your-2003-350z-new-seats,"<p>This weekend I spent some quality time finally working on the 350z before the upcoming autocross season (Dixie Champ Tour is coming up quickly). </p>

<p>In prep for STU I want to see what kind of weight I can get out of the car, I really don&rsquo;t know if this car (2003 Touring) can come anywhere close to what my first one (2003 Enthusiast, 3075lbs) weighed, or even the second one (2004 enthusiast, 3062). I have yet to get it up on the scales, but I assume going into this that the car is heaver than both of them. The power, heated, leather seats that came with the car, along with the potential extra stereo equipment, and electronics for the VDC mean the car likely weighs a good bit heaver than the previous cars.</p>

<p>[YouTube:SeUIINn3O50]</p>

<p>A week or two ago I headed out to Solo Performance to try on a few different seats. I wanted something that would drop weight, and add some rigidity and support. SPS has quite the selection of seats, and had an <a href=""http://soloperformance.com/NRG-Innovations-FRP-310-Racing-Bucket-Seat--Medium_p_11673.html"" target=""_blank"">NRG Innovations FRP-310</a>, which is their medium, fixed back seat. I&rsquo;m 6&rsquo;4&rdquo; and weight 250lbs (working on dropping that weight as well), and I actually fit semi-comfortably in this seat. I chose to go with the <a href=""http://soloperformance.com/NRG-Innovations-FRP-300-Racing-Bucket-Seat--Large_p_11672.html"" target=""_blank"">NRG Innovations FRP-300</a> instead however, this seat is the Large version of the one that SPS had in the shop.</p>

<p>We weighed the seats, along with a mount, on the SPS shipping scale and were shocked at what we found, the scale read what we thought was 9 pounds for the sat and 4 pounds for the mount. Dave at SPS also ordered me a set of <a href=""http://soloperformance.com/BuddyClub-Racing-Spec-Super-Low-Seat-Rail-Kit-Nissan-350ZG35-03-09_p_11496.html"" target=""_blank"">BuddyClub Racing Spec Super Low Seat Rail Kit Nissan 350Z/G35 03-09</a> to mount the seats into the car. All the parts arrived early last week, so I headed over to the shop on Sunday to work on removing the old seats, and putting in the new ones.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.project350z.com/Portals/4/PublishThumbnails/Windows-Live-Writer/How-to-drop-40lbs-from-your-2003-350z-ne_1297A/SeatsinBags_2.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img title=""SeatsinBags"" style=""border-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-style: solid; float: right; background-image: none;"" alt=""SeatsinBags"" src=""http://www.project350z.com/Portals/4/PublishThumbnails/Windows-Live-Writer/How-to-drop-40lbs-from-your-2003-350z-ne_1297A/SeatsinBags_thumb.jpg"" width=""244"" align=""right"" height=""184"" /></a>It is good to have a friend in the business, while I could have installed the seats in my own garage, having others around while working on the car and watching various other work get done on customer vehicles is motivating.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Installation of the seats is fairly straightforward, but it did take me far longer than I expected. The main problem I ran into is that, at 6&rsquo;4&rdquo;, I needed to have the seats in the lowest position possible when mounting them (driver&rsquo;s side all 4 corners on the lowest setting, passenger side 3 of the four, due to a hump in the passenger floorboard at the tunnel). Getting the seats onto the Buddy Club rails at the lowest position, was easy to do when I didn&rsquo;t tighten everything down, and test fitted the installation, but as soon as I tried to tighten everything down I pretty much had to try it multiple times to get things lined up correctly so that the rails didn&rsquo;t hit the bottom of the seats, and the holes in the rails lined up with the bolt holes in the floor.</p>

<p>Even with all the test fitting I did, after getting them mounted in I find that the sliders are binding up. Fortunately I can mover the driver&rsquo;s seat enough to make myself confortable, but anyone shorter is going to have troubles, so hopefully I can work out the binding issues down the road.</p>  <h3>350z Seat Weight</h3>  <p>When I got the seats and rails mounted, I decided to weight them, I was shocked at what I found, 11lbs. I then put the stock seats on the scale, and they weighed in at 19lbs. This was going to be a problem, in SCCA Autocross, STU class, you can replace the seats, but if you do, the replacement must weight 25 lbs. What advantage would I have of replacing my 19lb seat, with a 25lb seat, is the &ldquo;grip&rdquo; worth the extra 6 pounds. The more I thought about it, the more something had to be wrong with the scale. There&rsquo;s no way the stock seats only weighed 19 lbs. So off to grab a 25lb plate Dave had around the shop for help in corner weighting and alignment. I threw that on the scale, and boom, 11lbs. Wait, what? Quick check of the scale&rsquo;s display and we realized that the scale was in kilograms.</p>

<p>So how much did they weight? Well, the stock seats weighed in passenger 43.5lbs and driver 44.85 lbs , the NRG FRP-310s with Buddy Club rails, weight in at 24.45lbs (passenger) and 25lbs (driver). </p>  <table cellspacing=""0"" cellpadding=""2"" width=""300"" border=""0"">      <tbody>          <tr>              <td valign=""top"" style=""width: 150px;"">&nbsp;</td>              <td valign=""top"" style=""width: 150px;"">Weight</td>          </tr>          <tr>              <td valign=""top"" style=""width: 150px;"">OEM Touring Leather</td>              <td valign=""top"" style=""width: 150px;"">45lbs</td>          </tr>          <tr>              <td valign=""top"" style=""width: 150px;"">NRG FRP-310 w/ Buddy Club Brackets</td>              <td valign=""top"" style=""width: 150px;"">25lbs</td>          </tr>      </tbody>  </table>  <p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a title=""NRG FRP-310 Weight"" href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/25368468276/in/album-72157664702657730/"" data-footer=""true"" data-flickr-embed=""true"" target=""_blank""><img alt=""NRG FRP-310 Weight"" src=""https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1587/25368468276_36d70cee50_q.jpg"" width=""150"" height=""150"" align=""right"" style=""float: right;"" /></a>To get the passenger seat legal, I stuck 1/2 pound of lead wheel weights on the bottom of the seat. After reviewing the pictures I took, I saw that when I weighed the Passenger Side seat, I didn&rsquo;t have the slider arm on it, that might have made up for my weight difference.</p>

<p>How do they fit? Well, they fit the driver great, while they aren&rsquo;t all that comfortable for ingress/egress of the vehicle, when sitting in them they are amazing, I don&rsquo;t plan to do long road trips in them (hello trailer, soon) I think I could drive to/from Kansas City for an autocross in relative comfort. </p>  <h3>Door Panels</h3>  <p>The ONLY problem with the seats, the large (didn&rsquo;t test the medium size) is a little too wide up top for the stock door panels on the 350z. The doors press against them when they close, and due to the styrofoam body of the panels, they now have indentions in them from the doors pressing against the seats. I figured I have two options, 1) shave the seats down, removing the cover to file them or 2) leave them as is and not care about the door panels. I&rsquo;m going with option 2 for now, the car has a specific purpose, and that is to autocross, if I ever get annoyed by the indentions/damage to the panels perhaps I can find panels to replace them.</p>  <h3>Seat Height</h3>  <p><a href=""http://www.project350z.com/Portals/4/PublishThumbnails/Windows-Live-Writer/How-to-drop-40lbs-from-your-2003-350z-ne_1297A/2016-02-28%2016.45.43_2.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img title=""NRG FRP-310 Seat installed in 350z"" style=""border-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-style: solid; float: right; background-image: none;"" align=""right"" alt=""NRG FRP-310 Seat installed in 350z"" src=""http://www.project350z.com/Portals/4/PublishThumbnails/Windows-Live-Writer/How-to-drop-40lbs-from-your-2003-350z-ne_1297A/2016-02-28%2016.45.43_thumb.jpg"" width=""244"" height=""184"" /></a>The one thing I didn&rsquo;t test, is how the seats will do with a helmet on. I have a feeling I will likely rub a little bit on the top, but if necessary, I can always pull the padding from the bottom of the seat (and be sure to add weight) to drop down an inch or two in the seat while autocrossing. With times for autocross being fairly short, sitting without padding for those periods shouldn&rsquo;t be a huge deal.</p>

Weekend progress on the 350z,weekend-progress-on-the-350z,"<iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/W_L9OQWg1vE"" frameborder=""0"" width=""100%""></iframe>  <p>It was a good weekend on the 350z, I made progress on pretty much everything I needed/wanted to do to start the 2016 season, with only the corner balance and wheel alignment remaining. Those are scheduled for Monday at <a href=""http://SoloPerformance.com"" target=""_blank"">Solo Performance</a><sub></sub>.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a run down of what I was able to accomplish this weekend:</ul>
<p>      <li>Oil/Filter Change  </li>
<li>Plenum Spacer Removel  </li>
<li>Upper and Lower intake manifold cleaning  </li>
<li>Lower engine splash guard installed  </li>
<li>Passenger front fender liner replaced  </li>
<li>Replaced bolts for strut tower brace  </li>
<li>PlastiDip&rsquo;d strut tower brace  </li>
<li>Replaced missing plastic clips all around the front end, top and bottom</li>  </ul>
<p>When I removed the upper intake, to remove the Plenum spacer I found that the inside was a disgusting mess. I sprayed it with some carb cleaner before seeing &ldquo;not recommended on fuel injected vehicles&rdquo; on the can, so I headed off to pick up some throttle body/intake cleaner. Ideally I would have taken the entire lower manifold off and cleaned it, but I didn&rsquo;t have the lower gasket and after spending all day on the car I was anxious to finish up for the evening. I cleaned it up, but it still could be better (See photos below). After getting it all back together, I wasn&rsquo;t able to start the car, initially it started and ran for a moment, but after that it wouldn&rsquo;t fire.</p>

<p>I went to bed dejected, worried I had done something to damage the car. While laying in bed I started to question if I had reconnected the throttle body, so first thing in the morning when I awoke I went out to the garage to check, and sure enough, I hadn&rsquo;t fully connected the throttle body. I connected that up, and later in the morning after grabbing the keys I was able to start the car up without any problems.</p>

<p>In addition to the work on the 2003 350z, I also spent a bit of time working on a friend&rsquo;s 2014 Corvette Stingray. He&rsquo;s had it for 2 years now, with just over 6k miles on it, and after the brakes get warmed up it has a pretty annoying squeal/squeak that happens during low speed stops. He&rsquo;s had the service bulletin for &lsquo;14s done but that didn&rsquo;t help with the brake noise, so I have the car for a week or two to try and correct it. After being able to reproduce the problem, I determined that it appeared to be coming from the rear of the car. I took the rear pads off, applied some anti-squeal to the back of the pads and then drove it 100 miles this weekend around town, so far it appears that the problem has been resolved, but I&rsquo;ll drive it a few more times before he returns to see if it is truly fixed.</p>

The 2016 Autocross Season So Far,the-2016-autocross-season-so-far,"<iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/gH1Iwcm0suc"" frameborder=""0"" width=""100%"" allowfullscreen></iframe> <p>So it has been a while since I’ve had the time to get a blog post up here, so let’s get started.</p>
<p>After the last post, the car was almost ready for the Dixie National tour, held in Cecil Georgia, but there was some final prep to do. I took the car down to Solo Performance to corner weight and align the thing, with good results. </p>
<p><a title=""#350z #autocross #balance #weight # alignment"" href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/24969652024/in/dateposted-public/"" data-flickr-embed=""true""><img style=""float: none; margin-left: auto; display: block; margin-right: auto"" alt=""#350z #autocross #balance #weight # alignment"" src=""https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1621/24969652024_924a29b86a.jpg"" width=""500"" height=""500""></a><script async src=""//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js"" charset=""utf-8""></script></p> <h3 align=""center"">Alignment Specs:</h3>

<p align=""center"">Total empty weight was with all loose items removed (spare tire, tools, carpeting). Total weight with driver using additional weight to mimic driver.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p> <h3>St. Louis Region Test &amp; Tune</h3>
<p>The corner weight/alignment was completed just in time for the St. Louis region’s impromptu Test &amp; Tune. The weather didn’t pan out well, cold and wet, but the region did a great job of throwing together a last minute T&amp;T at Gateway Motorsports Park on March 13th.&nbsp; Due to the weather, not much was done in terms of actually testing and tuning, I used the event as a driver shakedown to try to get the winter rust out of my head, I also used it as a trial test of towing the car behind the 2008 Tahoe. </p> <h3>Dixie National Tour</h3>
<p>For the Dixie National Tour, Natalie and I towed the car down to Georgia (<a href=""http://izzyscustomcages.com/"" target=""_blank"">thanks to Izzy’s for the trailer</a>). We went down a couple of days early to spend a day with one of my bosses hiking through <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154059936489703&amp;set=a.230948829702.168653.685999702&amp;type=3&amp;permPage=1"" target=""_blank"">beautiful Amicalola Falls State Park</a>. After the hike and staying a night in the cabin, we headed down through Atlanta. I don’t know if I have ever had a good time driving through Atlanta, and this trip was probably the worst in terms of our experiences. Waze took us through downtown, getting off the highway, to try to avoid some of the accidents on the highway, but Waze obviously didn’t know we were pulling a car on a trailer, because the route was definitely not ideal for the rig.</p>
<p>We ended up in Valdosta Georgia a day earlier then planned, which ended up making things much easier on us Friday when we got up, washed the car, and headed out to the event site, the South Georgia Motorsports Park. Friday morning we parked, unloaded the car and headed over to the practice course to try to get more of the rust off (the driver). Practice went pretty well, though it was crazy busy, so long waits between the practice runs. Brian (former car owner) ended up taking some runs as well as he was going to be co-driving with me for the Dixie Tour. After practice runs I made Natalie head out for a bicycle ride with me, it was our first time experiencing riding for your life while being chased by some very angry dogs. Other than the dogs, the ride was flat, fast and great exercise.</p>
<p><a title=""Adel Georgia Bike Ride"" href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/25618888060/in/dateposted-public/"" data-flickr-embed=""true""><img style=""float: none; margin-left: auto; display: block; margin-right: auto"" alt=""Adel Georgia Bike Ride"" src=""https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1612/25618888060_455e4e775e.jpg"" width=""500"" height=""375""></a><script async src=""//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js"" charset=""utf-8""></script></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Saturday and Sunday for the Tour went well. Saturday morning started out wet, we ran first heat, but it was drying, so there was definitely an advantage to being second driver if you had two drivers, as the surface was getting dryer/faster every additional run. At the end of Saturday runs I was sitting in second place in the 7 driver STU class. Brian was sitting in the 3rd and final trophy spot. Sunday we both drove well, all driver’s in the heat benefited from dry runs. Both of us ended up falling back, myself one position to finish third (final trophy spot) and Brian back two, to fifth for the weekend. I was pleased with the result, and happy to finally have fun in the car, I was beginning to worry I wasn’t going to enjoy autocrossing this 350z after the first two events I had done in it.</p> <h3>Post Dixie National Tour</h3>
<p>From Dixie, the car was loaded up on the trailer and headed to Chattanooga (with Brian), while Natalie and I headed south to Orlando for a few days at a work convention. On the way back up to Chattanooga on Thursday morning to get the car, Brian sent me a txt telling me that someone had attempted to break into the car while it was sitting on the trailer at his shop. Somehow they were unsuccessful at getting in, but they did manage to bang up the driver’s door and window (about $1500-2,000 worth of damage).</p>

<p>The drive back through Atlanta was fun again, lots of accidents and idiots, along with the fact that I had the news about the car, it wasn’t a very fun day. We picked the car up and drove up to Tullahoma to stay the night, before heading to the Jack Daniel’s distillery on Friday morning. </p>

<p>The first local SCCA autocross in St. Louis was held on Sunday April 3, 2016. Over all the event went okay, I won the STU class by a couple of seconds, but ended up in 7th on the overall index. Not exactly the position I was hoping for. The car drove well, I feel like I just didn’t drive it to the full extent of how it can be driven, and my position on Index showed that result.</p>

<p>Event #2 of the St. Louis 2016 series was held this past Sunday at the Family Arena in St. Charles. Once again, I finished on top in the STU class, but this time in 8th overall on Index. Again, there was more in the car, though I don’t know if there was a full 1.2 seconds more, which is what I would have needed to move in front of the STF index winner.</p>

<p>My current tire pressures I’ve been running on the RE-71Rs is 31F/29R</p>
<p>Front Shocks at 9 clicks</p>
<p>Rear shocks at 1 full rotation (can’t get the darn clicks working on the back)</p> <h3>Trying out SoloStorm</h3>
<p>One thing I will be doing this year is trying to improve my driving. I find that overall my instincts are “pretty” good as to where I can go fast, and where I can’t, my gut gets me pretty far. But I honestly don’t think it gets me far enough. I have a hard time “improving” on autocross runs typically, meaning I’ll go out and put down a pretty quick time, but not improve much over the next 2 runs (more if local events), which means I am oftentimes not getting all that I should be out of the car, or myself. I am going to try to improve my driving through the use of technology, and the hot tool right now for that in Autocross is an Android app called <a href=""http://www.petreldata.com/product/solostorm-gps-obd-ii-and-video-logger-for-android-v2-2/"" target=""_blank"">SoloStorm</a>, from <a href=""http://www.petreldata.com/"" target=""_blank"">petreldata.com</a>. </p>
<p>With SoloStorm you can analyze the data from your runs quickly from an Android tablet inside of your car. In the past I’ve tried to look at data from the DL-1, on a laptop, between runs, but it was clunky and not easy enough to do that quickly. With SoloStorm you are able to look at runs, segments, and compare where you are faster or slower, this can be extremely useful when you have two drivers as you can compare your run to the other driver to see where you can each improve.</p>
<p>I haven’t used it just yet, I did try to get it working with my old-ass RaceTechnology DL-1, but wasn’t able to get the Tablet (Nexus 7 2013) and the DL-1 talking properly while on the parking lot at the Family Arena. I’m hoping to have the Bluetooth GPS&nbsp; hardware before my next event (<a href=""http://www.gatewayautox.com"">www.gatewayautox.com</a>) so look for more posts on SoloStorm in the coming weeks and months.</p> <h3>What’s Next?</h3>
<p>Next weekend (April 30, May 1st) I’ll be at the Grissom Classic in Peru Indiana, and the following weekend I’ll be at the Wilmington ProSolo. See you out at an event!</p>",2016-04-23 00:21:33.000,html,,,/Blog/itemId/569/The-2016-Autocross-Season-So-Far
2016 Wilmington ProSolo #1 and the 2016 Spring Nationals ProSolo and Champ Tour,2016-wilmington-prosolo-#1-and-the-2016-spring-nationals-prosolo-and-champ-tour,"<p>So here we are, another month has gone by since the last blog post, time for an update here on the status of <a href=""http://twitter.com/project350z"" target=""_blank"">@Project350z</a>.</p>
<p>TL;DR: Crap</p>
<p>So at the end of April I headed to Peru Indiana for the Gateway Autocross Association event at Grissom, I stuffed 4 tires into the 350z and headed on my way Friday afternoon.</p>    <blockquote class=""instagram-media"" data-instgrm-captioned="""" data-instgrm-version=""7"" style=""border-left-width: 0px; max-width: 658px; border-right-width: 0px; width: 99.37%; background: #fff; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 1px; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px; border-radius: 3px; box-shadow: 0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15)"">  <div style=""padding-bottom: 8px; padding-top: 8px; padding-left: 8px; padding-right: 8px"">  <div style=""width: 100%; background: #f8f8f8; margin-top: 40px; padding-bottom: 50%; text-align: center; padding-top: 50%; padding-left: 0px; line-height: 0; padding-right: 0px"">  <div style=""height: 44px; width: 44px; background: url(data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACwAAAAsCAMAAAApWqozAAAABGdBTUEAALGPC/xhBQAAAAFzUkdCAK7OHOkAAAAMUExURczMzPf399fX1+bm5mzY9AMAAADiSURBVDjLvZXbEsMgCES5/P8/t9FuRVCRmU73JWlzosgSIIZURCjo/ad+EQJJB4Hv8BFt+IDpQoCx1wjOSBFhh2XssxEIYn3ulI/6MNReE07UIWJEv8UEOWDS88LY97kqyTliJKKtuYBbruAyVh5wOHiXmpi5we58Ek028czwyuQdLKPG1Bkb4NnM+VeAnfHqn1k4+GPT6uGQcvu2h2OVuIf/gWUFyy8OWEpdyZSa3aVCqpVoVvzZZ2VTnn2wU8qzVjDDetO90GSy9mVLqtgYSy231MxrY6I2gGqjrTY0L8fxCxfCBbhWrsYYAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC); position: relative; margin: 0px auto -44px; display: block; top: -22px"">&nbsp;</div>  </div>    <p style=""padding-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 4px; margin: 8px 0px 0px; padding-right: 4px""><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/BEy1KUDQ92n/"" style=""font-size: 14px; word-wrap: break-word; text-decoration: none; font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-weight: normal; color: #000; font-style: normal; line-height: 17px"" target=""_blank"">Car full of tires #autocross #350z #bridgestone</a></p>    <p style=""font-size: 14px; overflow: hidden; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: arial,sans-serif; white-space: nowrap; margin-top: 8px; text-overflow: ellipsis; color: #c9c8cd; padding-bottom: 7px; text-align: center; padding-top: 8px; padding-left: 0px; line-height: 17px; padding-right: 0px"">A photo posted by Chris hammond (@project350z) on <time datetime=""2016-04-29T18:28:23+00:00"" style=""font-size: 14px; font-family: arial,sans-serif; line-height: 17px"">Apr 29, 2016 at 11:28am PDT</time></p>  </div>  </blockquote>  <script async defer src=""//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js""></script>    <p>How did the event go? It was darn cold, and I didn&rsquo;t dress for darn cold. I ended up leaving Sunday morning and driving home on the RE-71Rs (drove up on the Hankooks) because I was worried about hitting some rain on the way home, and knew that the Kooks would try to kill me with some water on the ground.</p>
<p>The following weekend I headed off to Wilmington Ohio. This time I wasn&rsquo;t taking an extra set of tires with me, I found out on Wednesday evening that the 285/30-18 RE-71Rs I ordered from <a href=""http://cjh.am/re-71r"">The Tire Rack</a> came in, I was fortunate enough to be able to have them delivered to Wilmington Friday afternoon. I spent a couple of hours at the Tire Discounters there in Wilmington as they got the old tires off and the new tires on. The event didn&rsquo;t go so well, I just didn&rsquo;t feel like I could get the car as fast as it needed to be, compared to other cars, I was off the pace for sure.</p>    <blockquote class=""instagram-media"" data-instgrm-captioned="""" data-instgrm-version=""7"" style=""border-left-width: 0px; max-width: 658px; border-right-width: 0px; width: 99.37%; background: #fff; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 1px; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px; border-radius: 3px; box-shadow: 0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15)"">  <div style=""padding-bottom: 8px; padding-top: 8px; padding-left: 8px; padding-right: 8px"">  <div style=""width: 100%; background: #f8f8f8; margin-top: 40px; padding-bottom: 28.12%; text-align: center; padding-top: 28.12%; padding-left: 0px; line-height: 0; padding-right: 0px"">  <div style=""height: 44px; width: 44px; background: url(data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACwAAAAsCAMAAAApWqozAAAABGdBTUEAALGPC/xhBQAAAAFzUkdCAK7OHOkAAAAMUExURczMzPf399fX1+bm5mzY9AMAAADiSURBVDjLvZXbEsMgCES5/P8/t9FuRVCRmU73JWlzosgSIIZURCjo/ad+EQJJB4Hv8BFt+IDpQoCx1wjOSBFhh2XssxEIYn3ulI/6MNReE07UIWJEv8UEOWDS88LY97kqyTliJKKtuYBbruAyVh5wOHiXmpi5we58Ek028czwyuQdLKPG1Bkb4NnM+VeAnfHqn1k4+GPT6uGQcvu2h2OVuIf/gWUFyy8OWEpdyZSa3aVCqpVoVvzZZ2VTnn2wU8qzVjDDetO90GSy9mVLqtgYSy231MxrY6I2gGqjrTY0L8fxCxfCBbhWrsYYAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC); position: relative; margin: 0px auto -44px; display: block; top: -22px"">&nbsp;</div>  </div>    <p style=""padding-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 4px; margin: 8px 0px 0px; padding-right: 4px""><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/BFHVwnrQ91M/"" style=""font-size: 14px; word-wrap: break-word; text-decoration: none; font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-weight: normal; color: #000; font-style: normal; line-height: 17px"" target=""_blank"">Saturday morning run #Wilmington #ProSolo #autocross #350z</a></p>    <p style=""font-size: 14px; overflow: hidden; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: arial,sans-serif; white-space: nowrap; margin-top: 8px; text-overflow: ellipsis; color: #c9c8cd; padding-bottom: 7px; text-align: center; padding-top: 8px; padding-left: 0px; line-height: 17px; padding-right: 0px"">A video posted by Chris hammond (@project350z) on <time datetime=""2016-05-07T17:38:02+00:00"" style=""font-size: 14px; font-family: arial,sans-serif; line-height: 17px"">May 7, 2016 at 10:38am PDT</time></p>  </div>  </blockquote>  <script async defer src=""//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js""></script>    <p>After Wilmington was a local event in which I ran the 275 tires again on the XXR 531 wheels.

Before the event I decided it was time to put the rear sway bar on the car, when I got the car it was removed.It felt much better, Tom and I finished 4th and 5th respectively on the PAX for that event (#4).</p>
<p>From there it was time to head to Lincoln, Nebraska for the Spring Nationals, both the ProSolo and the Championship Tour events. I managed to talk my father into driving out to Lincoln from Tucson, Arizona in his RV, mom flew on to Boston and her 50th college reunion, so dad and I got to spend a few great days together on the tarmac in Lincoln.</p>

<p>The events didn&rsquo;t do so great, the ProSolo I finished 5th out of 7 in the class. The only saving grace was my final run, after a red light of course, I managed to run the 2nd fastest class time on the right side. It wasn&rsquo;t worth anything, would have moved me up 1 spot, still out of trophies, but to me that made the whole weekend, I finally proved to myself that the car can do it,. The weekend ultimately was a story of me not being able to do it, but the car was capable. Rust, lots and lots of rust in the head.</p>
<p>After the ProSolo they held the National Tour (Champ tour). I finished better overall, there were 14 drivers in the tour, versus 7 in the Pro. I finished 7th, 2 out of trophies. Though I never did get the feeling I got on my last run of the ProSolo, the fast feeling.</p>
<p>After the poor showings in the National events I decided it was time to tear the car apart and see if change is what I need. I decided it was time to put the &ldquo;old&rdquo; suspension back on the car. What is the old suspension you might ask<a href=""http://www.project350z.com/Articles/itemId/553/BSP-350z-Suspension-Parts-and-Exhaust-for-Sale"" target=""_blank"">, well you can read about it here</a>, I never did sell the suspension off the old car, so I decided it was time to try that out.&nbsp; The car has been up on jack stands for a month now, I finally got around to getting, everything finished up today.</p>

<p>One additional thing I installed, there was a little issue with the potential legality of the previous camber arms on the rear end of the car. The arms came on the car when I purchased it, but I decided I didn&rsquo;t want to run the risk of them being challenged with a protest at a future event. So I ordered the Kinetix Racing Rear Camber/Traction package, though before installing the Toe arms I reread the rule book, at the encouragement of Greer, and realized that the toe arms are illegal in STU. So as part of the work today I installed the Camber arms.&nbsp; Later this week I&rsquo;ll get the alignment done, and see how the change works at the next local St. Louis event on the 17th of July.</p>    <blockquote class=""instagram-media"" data-instgrm-captioned="""" data-instgrm-version=""7"" style=""border-left-width: 0px; max-width: 658px; border-right-width: 0px; width: 99.37%; background: #fff; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 1px; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px; border-radius: 3px; box-shadow: 0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15)"">  <div style=""padding-bottom: 8px; padding-top: 8px; padding-left: 8px; padding-right: 8px"">  <div style=""width: 100%; background: #f8f8f8; margin-top: 40px; padding-bottom: 50%; text-align: center; padding-top: 50%; padding-left: 0px; line-height: 0; padding-right: 0px"">  <div style=""height: 44px; width: 44px; background: url(data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACwAAAAsCAMAAAApWqozAAAABGdBTUEAALGPC/xhBQAAAAFzUkdCAK7OHOkAAAAMUExURczMzPf399fX1+bm5mzY9AMAAADiSURBVDjLvZXbEsMgCES5/P8/t9FuRVCRmU73JWlzosgSIIZURCjo/ad+EQJJB4Hv8BFt+IDpQoCx1wjOSBFhh2XssxEIYn3ulI/6MNReE07UIWJEv8UEOWDS88LY97kqyTliJKKtuYBbruAyVh5wOHiXmpi5we58Ek028czwyuQdLKPG1Bkb4NnM+VeAnfHqn1k4+GPT6uGQcvu2h2OVuIf/gWUFyy8OWEpdyZSa3aVCqpVoVvzZZ2VTnn2wU8qzVjDDetO90GSy9mVLqtgYSy231MxrY6I2gGqjrTY0L8fxCxfCBbhWrsYYAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC); position: relative; margin: 0px auto -44px; display: block; top: -22px"">&nbsp;</div>  </div>    <p style=""padding-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 4px; margin: 8px 0px 0px; padding-right: 4px""><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/BGsOUutQ9z3/"" style=""font-size: 14px; word-wrap: break-word; text-decoration: none; font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-weight: normal; color: #000; font-style: normal; line-height: 17px"" target=""_blank"">New parts #350z</a></p>    <p style=""font-size: 14px; overflow: hidden; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: arial,sans-serif; white-space: nowrap; margin-top: 8px; text-overflow: ellipsis; color: #c9c8cd; padding-bottom: 7px; text-align: center; padding-top: 8px; padding-left: 0px; line-height: 17px; padding-right: 0px"">A photo posted by Chris hammond (@project350z) on <time datetime=""2016-06-15T21:56:21+00:00"" style=""font-size: 14px; font-family: arial,sans-serif; line-height: 17px"">Jun 15, 2016 at 2:56pm PDT</time></p>  </div>  </blockquote>    <p>Additionally I made a few changes to the suspension, I left the rear springs on the car, the setup there, with hypercoils, will allow me to swap them out easier to a heavier spring. The other thing, also in the rear, is that the Konis use the OEM upper mount, and unfortunately when I put the OEM suspension back on #2, I used the OEM mounts, so I tried to use the mounts from ISC setup, but the shaft of the Koni is smaller than the ISC, so the bushing doesn&rsquo;t work properly, I ordered the OEM bushings, and cut down the metal spacer to fit in the ISC mount. I remounted the Konis with the ISC setup and tried my best to get the alignment close to where it was when I started the process.</p>    <blockquote class=""instagram-media"" data-instgrm-captioned="""" data-instgrm-version=""7"" style=""border-left-width: 0px; max-width: 658px; border-right-width: 0px; width: 99.37%; background: #fff; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 1px; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px; border-radius: 3px; box-shadow: 0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15)"">  <div style=""padding-bottom: 8px; padding-top: 8px; padding-left: 8px; padding-right: 8px"">  <div style=""width: 100%; background: #f8f8f8; margin-top: 40px; padding-bottom: 50%; text-align: center; padding-top: 50%; padding-left: 0px; line-height: 0; padding-right: 0px"">  <div style=""height: 44px; width: 44px; background: url(data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACwAAAAsCAMAAAApWqozAAAABGdBTUEAALGPC/xhBQAAAAFzUkdCAK7OHOkAAAAMUExURczMzPf399fX1+bm5mzY9AMAAADiSURBVDjLvZXbEsMgCES5/P8/t9FuRVCRmU73JWlzosgSIIZURCjo/ad+EQJJB4Hv8BFt+IDpQoCx1wjOSBFhh2XssxEIYn3ulI/6MNReE07UIWJEv8UEOWDS88LY97kqyTliJKKtuYBbruAyVh5wOHiXmpi5we58Ek028czwyuQdLKPG1Bkb4NnM+VeAnfHqn1k4+GPT6uGQcvu2h2OVuIf/gWUFyy8OWEpdyZSa3aVCqpVoVvzZZ2VTnn2wU8qzVjDDetO90GSy9mVLqtgYSy231MxrY6I2gGqjrTY0L8fxCxfCBbhWrsYYAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC); position: relative; margin: 0px auto -44px; display: block; top: -22px"">&nbsp;</div>  </div>    <p style=""padding-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 4px; margin: 8px 0px 0px; padding-right: 4px""><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/BHsgASIA4PZ/"" style=""font-size: 14px; word-wrap: break-word; text-decoration: none; font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-weight: normal; color: #000; font-style: normal; line-height: 17px"" target=""_blank"">Finally getting there car back together #350z #koni #autocross #oldisnew</a></p>    <p style=""font-size: 14px; overflow: hidden; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: arial,sans-serif; white-space: nowrap; margin-top: 8px; text-overflow: ellipsis; color: #c9c8cd; padding-bottom: 7px; text-align: center; padding-top: 8px; padding-left: 0px; line-height: 17px; padding-right: 0px"">A photo posted by Chris hammond (@project350z) on <time datetime=""2016-07-10T21:02:15+00:00"" style=""font-size: 14px; font-family: arial,sans-serif; line-height: 17px"">Jul 10, 2016 at 2:02pm PDT</time></p>  </div>  </blockquote>  <script async defer src=""//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js""></script>    <p>Next on the car I would like to do a full header and exhaust install, but we&rsquo;ll see if I get there or not this year, we&rsquo;re looking at another $3500 I believe to make that happen.</p>  ",2016-07-11 00:44:14.000,html,,,/Blog/itemId/570/2016-Wilmington-ProSolo-#1-and-the-2016-Spring-N

<p>So the 2016 ProSolo series is nearing its end, with the final two events of the year being held within 6 hours of the house, I entered both. The Wilmington event turned out to be another disappointing one for me, not because of the location or people, but simply due to my lack of ability to drive this car lately.</p>
<p>I ended up disconnecting the rear sway bar after the Saturday morning runs, that made a world of difference on the car. I was finally able to control the car without constant fear of the back end breaking free on me. That being said, the back end did plenty of braking free all weekend, mainly through the finish!</p>
<p>[YouTube:Yh6jAPgv2-0]</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t end up getting the times I needed to in the car, finished somewhere 5th or 6th place, not even worth remembering!</p>
<p>The Blytheville ProSolo went just about the same, though because there were only 2 of us in the class, and the other guy&rsquo;s car broke, I took home 20 points for the event in STU. I didn&rsquo;t fair well in the bump class however, so there was no challenge for me.</p>
<p>Off to the ProSolo Finale here coming up in 2 weeks, then SoloNationals, hoping that I can fair better there than I have all year. There&rsquo;s also one local event coming up as well, perhaps that event will be the season&rsquo;s turning point!</p>
<p>Stay tuned for a new look on the 350z in the next few days.</p>  ",2016-08-21 23:18:44.000,html,,,/Blog/itemId/571/350z-at-the-Wilmington-Summer-and-Blytheville-Pr

I think the car can be competitive, I had some very competitive runs in it this year, enough to be near the top at National competitions, but I was unable to put multiple good runs in with the car, my head just wasn&rsquo;t in it all year. I need to change, do something else for 2017, maybe even take a year or two off and focus on other things. There&rsquo;s no reason for me to hold on to the car if I&rsquo;m not going to autocross it, so I would rather see it go to someone who will use it.</p>    <h3>What I would do if I were keeping the car?</h3>    <p>If I were going to keep the car, and there is always that chance, what would I do to it for 2017? The remaining projects to get the car fully prepped would include headers and high flow cats, a lighter exhaust, and then a full tune on the car. That is really the only thing I think that is necessary to finish the car off for STU.</p>    <h2>For Sale Details</h2>    <p>Year: 2003<br />  Make: Nissan<br />  Model: 350z Touring<br />  Mileage: 149,000<br />  Color: White<br />  Transmission: Manual (6-speed)</p>    <h2>Price: $9000 (with all the parts below, and anything else I have around)</h2>    <h3>Parts and Modifications list prepped for STU:</h3>    <h5>Front Suspension</h5>    <ul>   <li>Shocks: TrueChoice Phase 4 coilovers&nbsp;</li>   <li>(Removed, but included) ISC threaded-body front shocks.

Looking for another 350z,looking-for-another-350z,"<p>The time has come to revive the Project 350z. We are currently in the market for another car, (or V1 of Project350z if @Dozzle will sell it back).</p>
<p>Looking for a lower mileage car, manual transmission, preferably an Enthusiast model, but wouldn&#39;t be opposed to a Base this time around.</p>
<p>The more local to St. Louis the better.</p>
