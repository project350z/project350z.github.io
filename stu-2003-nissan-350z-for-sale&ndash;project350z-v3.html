									<h3>Why is the car for sale?</h3>
									<p>
										I simply struggled with the car this year. I think the car
										can be competitive, I had some very competitive runs in it
										this year, enough to be near the top at National
										competitions, but I was unable to put multiple good runs in
										with the car, my head just wasn&rsquo;t in it all year. I
										need to change, do something else for 2017, maybe even take
										a year or two off and focus on other things. There&rsquo;s
										no reason for me to hold on to the car if I&rsquo;m not
										going to autocross it, so I would rather see it go to
										someone who will use it.
									</p>
									<h3>What I would do if I were keeping the car?</h3>
									<p>
										If I were going to keep the car, and there is always that
										chance, what would I do to it for 2017? The remaining
										projects to get the car fully prepped would include headers
										and high flow cats, a lighter exhaust, and then a full tune
										on the car. That is really the only thing I think that is
										necessary to finish the car off for STU.
