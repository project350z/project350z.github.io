									<p>
										This weekend I spent some quality time finally working on
										the 350z before the upcoming autocross season (Dixie Champ
										Tour is coming up quickly).
									</p>

									<p>
										In prep for STU I want to see what kind of weight I can get
										out of the car, I really don&rsquo;t know if this car (2003
										Touring) can come anywhere close to what my first one (2003
										Enthusiast, 3075lbs) weighed, or even the second one (2004
										enthusiast, 3062). I have yet to get it up on the scales,
										but I assume going into this that the car is heaver than
										both of them. The power, heated, leather seats that came
										with the car, along with the potential extra stereo
										equipment, and electronics for the VDC mean the car likely
										weighs a good bit heaver than the previous cars.
									</p>

									<p>[YouTube:SeUIINn3O50]</p>

									<p>
										A week or two ago I headed out to Solo Performance to try on
										a few different seats. I wanted something that would drop
										weight, and add some rigidity and support. SPS has quite the
										selection of seats, and had an
										<a
											href="http://soloperformance.com/NRG-Innovations-FRP-310-Racing-Bucket-Seat--Medium_p_11673.html"
											target="_blank"
											>NRG Innovations FRP-310</a
										>, which is their medium, fixed back seat. I&rsquo;m
										6&rsquo;4&rdquo; and weight 250lbs (working on dropping that
										weight as well), and I actually fit semi-comfortably in this
										seat. I chose to go with the
										<a
											href="http://soloperformance.com/NRG-Innovations-FRP-300-Racing-Bucket-Seat--Large_p_11672.html"
											target="_blank"
											>NRG Innovations FRP-300</a
										>
										instead however, this seat is the Large version of the one
										that SPS had in the shop.
									</p>

									<p>
										We weighed the seats, along with a mount, on the SPS
										shipping scale and were shocked at what we found, the scale
										read what we thought was 9 pounds for the sat and 4 pounds
										for the mount. Dave at SPS also ordered me a set of
										<a

											target="_blank"
											>BuddyClub Racing Spec Super Low Seat Rail Kit Nissan
											350Z/G35 03-09</a
										>
										to mount the seats into the car. All the parts arrived early
										last week, so I headed over to the shop on Sunday to work on
										removing the old seats, and putting in the new ones.

										>It is good to have a friend in the business, while I could
										have installed the seats in my own garage, having others
										around while working on the car and watching various other
										work get done on customer vehicles is motivating.
									</p>

									<p>&nbsp;</p>

									<p>
										Installation of the seats is fairly straightforward, but it
										did take me far longer than I expected. The main problem I
										ran into is that, at 6&rsquo;4&rdquo;, I needed to have the
										seats in the lowest position possible when mounting them
										(driver&rsquo;s side all 4 corners on the lowest setting,
										passenger side 3 of the four, due to a hump in the passenger
										floorboard at the tunnel). Getting the seats onto the Buddy
										Club rails at the lowest position, was easy to do when I
										didn&rsquo;t tighten everything down, and test fitted the
										installation, but as soon as I tried to tighten everything
										down I pretty much had to try it multiple times to get
										things lined up correctly so that the rails didn&rsquo;t hit
										the bottom of the seats, and the holes in the rails lined up
										with the bolt holes in the floor.
									</p>

									<p>
										Even with all the test fitting I did, after getting them
										mounted in I find that the sliders are binding up.
										Fortunately I can mover the driver&rsquo;s seat enough to
										make myself confortable, but anyone shorter is going to have
										troubles, so hopefully I can work out the binding issues
										down the road.
									</p>
									<h3>350z Seat Weight</h3>
									<p>
										When I got the seats and rails mounted, I decided to weight
										them, I was shocked at what I found, 11lbs. I then put the
										stock seats on the scale, and they weighed in at 19lbs. This
										was going to be a problem, in SCCA Autocross, STU class, you
										can replace the seats, but if you do, the replacement must
										weight 25 lbs. What advantage would I have of replacing my
										19lb seat, with a 25lb seat, is the &ldquo;grip&rdquo; worth
										the extra 6 pounds. The more I thought about it, the more
										something had to be wrong with the scale. There&rsquo;s no
										way the stock seats only weighed 19 lbs. So off to grab a
										25lb plate Dave had around the shop for help in corner
										weighting and alignment. I threw that on the scale, and
										boom, 11lbs. Wait, what? Quick check of the scale&rsquo;s
										display and we realized that the scale was in kilograms.
									</p>

									<p>
										So how much did they weight? Well, the stock seats weighed
										in passenger 43.5lbs and driver 44.85 lbs , the NRG FRP-310s
										with Buddy Club rails, weight in at 24.45lbs (passenger) and
										25lbs (driver).

										>To get the passenger seat legal, I stuck 1/2 pound of lead
										wheel weights on the bottom of the seat. After reviewing the
										pictures I took, I saw that when I weighed the Passenger
										Side seat, I didn&rsquo;t have the slider arm on it, that
										might have made up for my weight difference.
									</p>

									<p>
										How do they fit? Well, they fit the driver great, while they
										aren&rsquo;t all that comfortable for ingress/egress of the
										vehicle, when sitting in them they are amazing, I
										don&rsquo;t plan to do long road trips in them (hello
										trailer, soon) I think I could drive to/from Kansas City for
										an autocross in relative comfort.
									</p>
									<h3>Door Panels</h3>
									<p>
										The ONLY problem with the seats, the large (didn&rsquo;t
										test the medium size) is a little too wide up top for the
										stock door panels on the 350z. The doors press against them
										when they close, and due to the styrofoam body of the
										panels, they now have indentions in them from the doors
										pressing against the seats. I figured I have two options, 1)
										shave the seats down, removing the cover to file them or 2)
										leave them as is and not care about the door panels.
										I&rsquo;m going with option 2 for now, the car has a
										specific purpose, and that is to autocross, if I ever get
										annoyed by the indentions/damage to the panels perhaps I can
										find panels to replace them.
									</p>
									<h3>Seat Height</h3>

										>The one thing I didn&rsquo;t test, is how the seats will do
										with a helmet on. I have a feeling I will likely rub a
										little bit on the top, but if necessary, I can always pull
										the padding from the bottom of the seat (and be sure to add
										weight) to drop down an inch or two in the seat while
										autocrossing. With times for autocross being fairly short,
										sitting without padding for those periods shouldn&rsquo;t be
										a huge deal.
