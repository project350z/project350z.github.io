									<p>
										I finally broke down and bought some Koni Sports for the
										<a target="_blank" href="http://www.project350z.com"
											>Project Z</a
										>. I say finally but they really have only been stateside
										for 2 months now, so I didn’t wait all that long to order
										them. At the end of this write-up you’ll find a summary of
										my autocross career, to get a better understanding of the
										author of this piece.
									</p>

									<p><strong>The part numbers are as follows.</strong></p>

									<p>
										8241-1216L Sport Left Front <br />
										8241-1216R Sport Right Front <br />
										8241-1217 Sport Rear (single)
									</p>

									<p>
										<strong>Installation procedures</strong> <br />
										I have the Nissan Service Manual for the 350Z, and would
										highly recommend purchasing one as they are invaluable when
										it comes to working on your vehicle. I won’t be using any
										photos from the manual, as reproducing it on the web would
										most likely be a little frowned upon by Nissan. I will
										however try to include pictures with notations on
										installation procedures.
									</p>

									<p>
										I would also recommend checking out the article on SportZ
										Magazine’s latest issue on the Koni install procedure, I
										received a copy of the article and found it to be very
										helpful.
									</p>

									<p>
										To begin the car was placed on our lift and raised off of
										the ground about 3 feet . We removed all four wheels from
										the vehicle before we did any other work to make everything
										easier and to get them out of the way. <br />

										<strong>Rear Shock Install</strong> <br />
										I started with the rear of the car, and it was by far the

										I removed this top nut from the shock using an impact gun.
										It may take a little working with to get it removed without
										spinning the shaft too much, but if you drive it back on and
										off a few times it will usually free up. Being that this was
										a stock shock which would only go back on the car if I sell
										it, I wasn’t too concerned with spinning the shaft. I do not
										recommend using a gun to drive the nut back onto the Koni
										shock, more on that later.
									</p>

									<p>
										Now to reassemble the rear shocks. I didn’t take a picture
										of the parts included with the rears but you can sort of see
										this bag in the picture below (yellow arrow), there is a nut
										in there for the bottom shock mount, a nut for the shaft,
										and a what is really just a large metal washer that goes
										into the upper shock mount.
									</p>

									<p>
										This is how the stock upper mount comes off of the stock
										shock (upside down). You’ll want to set aside the metal
										shield that has a red arrow marked discard on it.. The
										washer is used to keep the rubber grommet (yellow arrow
										marked grommet)&#160; from pushing down on the rear shock
										adjustment mechanism. Please notice the installation order
										in the picture, you would really hate to get everything
										installed incorrectly wouldn’t you? (see our front install
										for an example ?) You’ll notice a little orange ring; to me
										it appears to be a gasket for the upper mount to the body of
										the car. I just left this in place throughout the install.
										Please see the included Koni paperwork, what little there
										actually is, for the proper torque settings for the nut on
										the top of the shock. You can tighten down this nut with a
										wrench, and use a pair of pliers or channel locks to hold
										the shaft in place, notice the flat sides of the top of the
										shaft for this. <br />

									<p>
										When putting the shock back onto the car here is a tip I
										pulled out of the article in SportZ Magazine. You can
										compress the shock before you put it back on the car, it
										will slow rebound it self back into position, but it should
										give you PLENTY of time to get the shock in place on the
										car. I would recommend compressing the shock, get it lined
										up with the lower mount and the upper mount, then put the
										bolt (from the stock shock) into the bottom mount of the
										shock with the Koni included nut on the other side of the
										mount. This will keep the base of the shock in place while
										you try to get the upper mount installed.
									</p>

									<p>
										The upper mount may be a little tricky to line up, if the
										shock doesn’t rebound completely to the top of the fender
										wheel (to the mounting bolts) you may try raising the rear
										suspension of the side you are working on with a jack,
										basically compressing it as though the car where sitting
										with weight on that corner. This will allow getting the
										shock into the upper mount properly without to much hassle.
										Tighten down the bolts on the top mount, see image 16 above.
										One thing to remember when doing this install, you want the
										adjustment mechanism of the shock to be easily accessible,
										so you want it facing out, you should be able to turn it a
										little when you have the shock back on the car, but it’s
										best to try to have it facing out to begin with..
									</p>

									<p>
										Don’t forget to torque down the lower mount as well. The
										article from SportZ Magazine recommends doing this while the
										car is setting on the ground, for the front and the rear
										shocks,&#160; as tightening the lower mounts at this time
										help to prevent premature wear on the components. That isn’t
										exactly the easiest thing to do, but I would highly
										recommend it. If you don’t get the lower bolt/nut tightened
										well you will get a clunking noise from this lower mount.
										(ask me how I know).
									</p>

									<p>
										Repeat this process on the other rear shock for the car.
										This is what it looks like when finished.
									</p>

										<strong>Front Shock Install</strong> <br />
										The front shock install is requires a bit more work than the
										rear install did. You will also need a spring compressor of
										some sort to disassemble the front shock units. I borrowed
										this tool from a local autozone. Basically the way it works
										is you pay for the tool and you return it when you are done
										if you want your money back. This isn’t like the Wal-mart
										rental policy; this is actually a legit program.

										The FSM tells you to remove the wheel, and then the under
										cover. I never did figure out what the “under cover” was
										that it referenced, but I obviously didn’t have to remove it
										to get the shock out if I couldn’t find it.
									</p>

									<p>
										(This step differs on cars with TCS and VDC, this step was
										performed on a car with only TCS) Next you will remove the
										Wheel sensors from the back of the hub. The wheel sensor has
										a cable that is marked with the yellow arrows in this image
										. This image shows what the sensor looks like mounted on the
										back of the hub. . When removing the wheel sensor be
										careful, the FSM specifically says not to pull on the wheel
										sensor.&#160; Pull out the two grommets where the wire is
										attached to the shock body, and then use a wrench or socket
										to remove the bolt holding the sensor itself to the hub.
										Place the sensor up and out of the way, try not to twist the
										cable too much, when you go to install the sensor again make
										sure that the white line does not twist upon install. I set
										the sensor on what I would assume is the “under cover”
										towards the front of the car to keep it and the cable out of
										the way while I removed the shock.

										Next remove the nut that holds the brake hose to the shock

									<p>
										You’ll also need to remove the strut tower bar. To do this
										you’ll want to fix the center bolt in place and loosen the
										nut on the left and right side of that center bolt. Once
										those are lose you’ll want to turn the center top towards
										the rear of the car 660 degrees, that should place the
										silver mark of the center bolt above. Remove the 3 bolts and
										one nut from each of the strut bar mounts and remove the bar
										from the vehicle.
									</p>

									<p>
										One thing the FSM doesn’t tell you to do, but the SportZ
										article recommends is to remove this cotter pin and nut,
										this will give you some slack when removing the shock and
										make removal a lot easier. Note: Yours should not be
										painted, I took mine to a horrible place and they did a
										horrible job repainting the front end. I also remove the nut
										from the sway bar link to the transverse bar (no picture).

										Remove the bolt and nut on the lower shock mount, holding
										the shock to the transverse link. (I don’t seem to have a
										picture of this either). You may want to leave the bolt in
										the lower mount to help keep it in place while you perform
										the next step.
									</p>

									<p>
										Now you’ll remove the nuts from the upper mount, you should
										see them exposed by the removal of the strut bar. Remove the
										bolt from the lower mount and you should now be able to pull
										the assembly off of the car. If you need to you can put a
										little pressure on the break disc to push the lower
										suspension assembly down to give you better access to remove
										the assembly.
									</p>

									<p>
										<strong>Front Shock disassembly <br /> </strong
										><em>(ALWAYS USE CAUTION WHEN WORKING WITH SPRINGS)</em>
										<br />
										Using the spring compressor from the picture above compress
										the spring so that it has a little play between the lower
										spring perch and the upper mount. This will allow you to
										remove the nut from the top of the shock. I used an impact
										gun for removal, if it doesn’t come off easily on the first
										try, drive the nut back down and try removal again, working
										it in this manner helped me remove the nuts without much
										trouble. Without an impact gun you’ll need to try to hold
										the top of the shock in place with locks and turn the nut
										with a wrench. From past experience, try to use an impact
										gun for this, or you should spend hours trying to get things
										apart.
									</p>

									<p>
										Once you have the nut free remove the upper mount and boot
										(attached) you can them remove the compressed spring. <br />

										Koni supplies you with these parts, along with a spring
										perch that goes on the shock body.&#160; The white washer
										goes on top of the shock body (yellow arrow) and the spring
										perch sets where the red arrow is pointing. . This is NOT
										how the spring perch goes, this picture shows the perch in
										an upside down position. . To see if you have the perch
										lined up properly put the perch on the new shock and hold
										the new and old shock side by side, you’ll see if the
										perches line up. I learned that little trick after I
										reassembled the right front shock, so I had to redo that
										side. <br />

										When holding them up side by side you should be able to line
										the perch up on the new shock body closely to the way the
										perch is fixed on the stock body. This allows for the proper
										placement of the spring, which eases the assembly of the

										Place the spring back onto the perch, still compressed in
										the spring compressors, and then put the boot and upper
										mount back onto the shock. You will at this time need to put
										the washer and nut included in the picture of parts above
										back onto the shock. This should be done by hand, not with
										an impact gun as you don’t want to PreLoad the shock’s
										rebound settings by twisting the shaft. You should be able
										to hand twist the nut on, and use a pair of wrenches to get
										the nut on securely. If you do not get this nut on tight it
										WILL make noise. It took me a few days of lifting the car up
										and down trying to figure out where I was getting a knocking
										from. It ended up being because when I had to redo the right
										front shock I didn’t get the nut on the shaft of the shock
										tightened down properly. The proper torque settings are
										included in the Koni documentation, which I do not have
										handy at the moment. Once you have the nut tightened down on
										the shock you’ll need to remove the spring compressors.
									</p>

									<p>
										Now it’s time to install this assembly back onto the car. I
										did the install in this manner. Get the top of the shock
										assembly into the general area of the upper mounting point
										to that the shaft of the shock is inside the open whole at
										the top of the mount. Try to get the lower mount into place,
										feed the included bolt from Koni into the lower mount to
										hold the assembly in place but don’t tighten it down yet..
										From the top of the car you can pull up on the spring to
										raise the suspension assembly into place to alight the three
										bolts in the upper strut mount to line up properly with the
										three wholes in the body of the car. Get at least one of the
										nuts started so that you can quit pulling up on the spring!
									</p>

									<p>
										<br />
										Everything else should be fairly straight forward to
										reinstall. Be sure to properly torque everything down to the
										settings in the FSM. When installing the wheel sensors be
										sure to not twist the cables. I can speak from experience,
										go over everything, make sure you tighten everything down,
										the little knocks get rather annoying, and it’s easier to
										get everything the first time then to have to go back and
										look for something you missed.
									</p>

									<p>
										I’ll have to do a write-up on the performance on these
										shocks next week. From a week and a half of driving, and one
										autocross event though I will include a few observations.
									</p>

									<p>
										<strong>First Event on Konis</strong> <br />
										I ran a two day divisional less than 48 hours after
										installing the Koni’s on the Project 350Z. The first day I
										started with the rear shocks at 3 turns from full soft, and
										the front at one full turn from full soft. To give you an
										idea of what settings the shocks have I believe the rears
										have 12 turns to get to their stiffest rebound setting, and
										the fronts appear to have 2.5 full turns from soft to firm.
										Each turn on the rear is probably ¼ of a turn if they were
										adjusted from the top as the fronts are.
									</p>

									<p>
										After my 2nd run I decided to try taking out ½ turn from the
										fronts. This was what I would call a mistake! The car got
										extremely loose on my 3rd run, which helped to kick the ABS
										ice-mode on, a problem I had last year at the Topeka
										ProSolo, and Carter had in his 350Z at Nationals last year.
										We figure this is caused by the car sensing one wheel is
										different from the others, probably off the ground when the
										others are on the ground, so the brakes freak out and don’t
										want to stop the car. It doesn’t pulse like ABS is kicking
										in, but the car stops breaking like it should and
										decelerates at a slower rate. My 99 Camaro had the same
										problem on the Topeka concrete under extremely hard braking.
									</p>

									<p>
										For my 4th run I put ¼ turn back into the shocks, this made
										a pretty good combination, as the car felt more settled than
										run 3, but still loose enough to work with. On Monday (2nd
										day) I left the settings the same on the car, and ran a bit
										closer to the leader in BS for the weekend. I ended up in
										3rd for the event, I had been in 4th by .005 or so behind
										Lee from Oklahoma in a Track model 2004 I believe.
									</p>

									<p>
										I’m headed to OKC this weekend for the 2nd divisional event,
										and will report back on my settings when I return! I hope
										this is helpful to someone else out there in doing their
										install. If you have any questions, or notice any blatant
										errors in this please feel free to let me know via the
										comment section of this blog!

									<p><strong>About the Myself (the author)</strong></p>

									<p>
										I’ve been autocrossing since March of 2000. I started out in
										a 1994 VW Golf III, and competed in that car for about 15
										months. I competed in my first National Tour event in Peru
										Indiana in July, and then the SCCA Solo II Nationals in
										September. I finished last in both events in the newly
										formed STS (street touring) class. In July of 2001 I decided
										I wanted to buy a car that I knew could be competitive with
										just the minor modifications that were allowed in the stock
										classing structure of SCCA Solo II. I decided on F-Stock,
										and started looking for a 4th Generation F-Body (Camaro)
										that would suite my needs.
									</p>

									<p>
										I was looking around St. Louis for a few weeks for a LS-1
										powered (98+) 6 speed, that wasn’t in Red. I found a 1999
										Z-28 in Macon Missouri and picked it up. I immediately
										purchased a set of Koni Shocks for the car, an extra set of
										wheels, and some R-compound tires. At the Solo Nationals
										that year (2001) I still got kicked in the rear, but not
										near as bad this time! I can’t seem to find the results from
										that year, but I think I finished something like 47th out of
										54. In 2002 I finished 14th in F-Stock out of 35+ entrants.
										I also finished 3rd in F-Stock at the Topeka ProSolo that
										April.
									</p>

									<p>
										In 2003 I decided to change vehicles and purchased my 2003
										Nissan 350Z Enthusiast model. I acquired a second set of the
										stock Enthusiast 17” wheels for a set of R-compound tires. I
										competed last year at the Peru National Tour, the Topeka
										ProSolo and the SCCA Solo II Nationals. At Nationals I
										finished 43rd out of 60 drivers. I was the second fastest
										350Z driver, but far behind Carter Thompson who finished
										6th. I was also running on Kumhos, even though the 2003
										Results say I was on Hoosiers.
									</p>

									<p>
										Along comes 2004, I kind of lost interest in autocross up
										through the end of May. I guess I go through a little lull
										every year, this year it happened in April and May. To get
										out of the lull I ordered the Koni Sports (yellows) for the
										car.
