Project350z.com was originally about a boy and his toy. Originally picked up from a friend in Farmington, Missouri on May 7th, 2006, the car spent almost 4 years with Chris Hammond. He got it running with a turbo motor from a 280z, and then blew that motor up on its first autocross run.

Eventually Chris and his wife moved to Colorado, then on to California. The car was sold in Colorado.

This website was used to track the progress of the build. The website is kept around for archival purposes, and with hopes that one day Chris will own another Datsun 240z.

Chris also has [Project350z.com](https://www.project350z.com) and Project370z/Project400z with hopes that one day both of those websites have a vehicle as well.
