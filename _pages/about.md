Project350z.com was originally about a boy and his toy. The first was a 2003 350z Enthusiast Package. That car was campaigned for 3 years and then sold to a Dozzle in Kansas City (he still owns it and won't sell it back).

The second was a 2004 Enthusiast. Picked up in Colorado in January 2010, it travelled to California and spent 2 years there before being sold.

The third was a 2003 Touring that was acquired in 2016. That only stuck around 2 years before making its way to Florida, and then recently on to Colorado.

What will the 4th be? Who knows.
