										>This weekend, being what is likely the last warm weekend of
										2015, I decided it was time to wash/claybar/wax the 350z.
										The weather was beautiful, I spent most of Saturday
										afternoon performing the first two steps, washing and clay
										bar&rsquo;ng the car. The car was pretty clean, but there
										were some decent cone marks/residue on the side skirts from
										the previous owner, most of the time spent with the clay bar
										was there, though there were various other locations on the
										car that needed attention as well.
									</p>
									<h2>Clay Bar basics</h2>
									<p>
										If you&rsquo;ve never taken a clay bar to the paint on your
										car, here&rsquo;s a quick primer. A clay bar is used to
										clean up particulates in paint and to remove wax, and if you
										autocross, it is rather useful for cleaning up cone marks.
										The first thing you need to do before using the bar is to
										Wash the car. Drying the car isn&rsquo;t really necessary as
										you will be washing it again after you finish with the bar.
										Once you&rsquo;ve watched the car, you can use a lubricant
										(detailer mist/spray) to work the clay bar over small
										sections of the car. You will notice that as you run the bar
										over the car you will feel the paint smooth out, this
										happens when the bar picks up the crap from the paint. Be
										careful not to drop the clay bar on the ground, if you do
										this it will be covered in grit and crap that you definitely
										don&rsquo;t want to rub back into the paint of the car.
									</p>

									<p>
										Once you&rsquo;ve finished one spot, move on to the next. I
										ended up not using detailer spray yesterday and just used
										soapy water, then rinsed that water/soap off with hose every
										few minutes. If you find trouble spots, scratches,
										imperfections, it is worth trying to run the clay bar over
										these spots, sometimes it takes 5-10 minutes of work, but
										often times it will clean up with enough effort, this is
										especially true of cone marks on the bottom portion of side
										skirts.
									</p>

									<p>
										After finishing with the clay bar you&rsquo;re going to want
										to wash your vehicle again to get any residue that remains
										from the clay bar and the detailer spray off the car. I
										dried the car with a California car squeegee, and then my
										shammy. I took the blower and tried to get any remaining
										water out of the seams of the car and then parked it in the
										garage for a couple of hours to let it fully dry. Last night
										I then applied a coat of polish before turning in for the
										night. This morning I woke up early and put a coat of wax on
										the car, and decided it was time to clean the headlights up.
									</p>
									<h2>Cleaning 350z Headlights</h2>
									<p>
										The headlights on my car were in two different states, the
										passenger side headlight has some stress cracks, but the
										surface plastic only had a very faint fog to it. I was able
										to clean this fog off with a simple headlight restoration
										polish that I&rsquo;ve had for a few years, it was simple,
										rub it on, wipe it off, good as new (minus the cracks).
									</p>

									<p>
										The driver&rsquo;s side headlight however was not in near as
										nice a shape, it appeared to have over spray on it, as well
										as scuffs likely from a sanding process when the car was
										painted at some point. The headlight polish I used on the
										passenger side, didn&rsquo;t do a lick of good on the
										driver&rsquo;s side. For this I chose to go with
										&ldquo;Meguiar's G2000 Perfect Clarity Two Step Headlight
										Restoration Kit&rdquo;, this kit comes with an abrasive pad
										(2x), a rubbing compound (step 1), and a clear coat spray
										(step 2).
									</p>

									<p>
										Step 1) Don&rsquo;t be afraid here, but you are going to
										scratch the crap out of your headlight lens, step 2 will
										make this better. I had to spend a good 15-20 minutes
										working on the driver&rsquo;s side lens due to the scuffing
										and fogging on the plastic. The abrasive pad and the
										polishing compound should be used in one direction, not in a
										swirling motion. I wiped the product off every couple of
										minutes to try to check my progress, when you are done with
										this you will need to use a wet rag to wipe the residue off.
										One thing I did for this, due to the abrasive nature of the
										product, I taped over the paint with blue painters tape, to
										protect the paint around the headlamp from scratches. When I
										do this again on another vehicle, I would actually use tape
										and newspaper to cover a larger area (due to step 2).
									</p>

									<p>
										Step 2) The instructions for the product don&rsquo;t tell
										you much about this, but Step 2 is a spray can of clear coat
										that will restore the gloss and shine to your headlamps. Be
										sure to tape off the area around the lamp if you
										haven&rsquo;t done this already for Step 1. Basically you
										spray the clear coat on in two separate applications,
										waiting 3-5 minutes for the first coat to dry.
									</p>

									<p>
										I must admit, I was not thrilled about scratching up the
										headlights even more to use this kit, but the end results
										was most definitely worth it!
									</p>
