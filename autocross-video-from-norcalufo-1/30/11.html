I got to the event and heard that they had a course worker get hit at their last event, unfortunately he was hurt pretty bad and of course doesn’t have insurance, so they were taking donations. I assume that their insurance doesn’t cover the injuries? I believe (could be wrong) that SCCA events always have insurance that would cover someone who got injured, but perhaps I’m wrong. The odd thing is this is the SECOND course worker they’ve had hit in the past 6 or 9 months. Not exactly something that you want to hear when you show up.

										Sunday I partook in the NorCalUFO autocross, their second
										event of the year, my first attending since the baby was
										born in October. I got to the event and heard that they had
										a course worker get hit at their last event, unfortunately
										he was hurt pretty bad and of course doesn’t have insurance,
										so they were taking donations. I assume that their insurance
										doesn’t cover the injuries? I believe (could be wrong) that
										SCCA events always have insurance that would cover someone
										who got injured, but perhaps I’m wrong. The odd thing is
										this is the SECOND course worker they’ve had hit in the past
										6 or 9 months. Not exactly something that you want to hear
										when you show up. (Mental note, keep that in mind when
										signing up for worker positions)
									</p>

									<p>
										WOOOOOOWHOOOO! Fun at an autocross again. It’s been a few
										events since I’ve really had fun at an autocross. This time
										around I was still on the crappy street tires, which
										actually I think are worse than before as the rears are
										getting pretty bald, it was wet, so that made things more
										interesting.
									</p>

									<p>
										I started out the morning by driving down to Marina (about
										an hour and 40 minutes), stopping to get a bite to eat, and
										then to grab a gallon of gas when I got there. I got to the
										site around 7:30am and got registered for BSP, and signed up
										for the “course monitor” work assignment for the 4th run
										group.
									</p>

									<p>
										I took 3 video cameras with me (4 if you count my DSLR), my
										GoProHD, my original GoPro and my ChaseCam. Unfortunately
										the original GoPro is such as POS that it failed to work for
										a single run… go figure. I love the GoProHD, but I tell you
										being an early adopter of GoPro (I got the first one in
										December 2007) was a mistake, their original cameras just
										flat out suck. If anyone from GoPro is reading this, I will
										gladly trade you guys my original one for another GoProHD,
										contact me!
									</p>

									<p>
										My first run I went out with tire pressures around 48/46psi,
										it was like a drifter’s dream, wet surface, bald tires with
										high pressure, the rear end was moving around like a girl
										putting herself through college in east St. Louis. Here’s a
										video of the run, both from the top of the car, and inset
										with the passenger side view of the right front tire, watch
										all over the steering correction while the car dances.

									<p>
										With all that moving around I was sure when I cross the
										finish lights I had taken out at least 4 cones, but the
										final results show only 1, but a nice and slow time of 53
										seconds.
									</p>

									<p>
										The second run was a little better than the first, improving
										on raw time, and clean. The third run however is another
										story, I was going okay until a couple of turns before the
										finish when the rear of the car decided to do the old Sauget
										shuffle and batted a few cones off course (video coming
										soon) My third run was the fastest up to that point, but I
										had 4 cones today based on the results.

									<p>
										My 4th and final run was when the fun finally kicked in. The
										course was starting to dry out more and I took a serious
										drop in tire pressure, going down to 38/36. Talk about a big
										improvement, the tires were starting to squeal (I hate
										street tires) due to the drying surface. I got down to
										around a 48.9 on that run. Much improvement, not enough to
										put me into the lead in BSP but I was happy with a very
										under prepared car on super cheap street tires.
