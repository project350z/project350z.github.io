										So it has been a while since I’ve had the time to get a blog
										post up here, so let’s get started.
									</p>

									<p>
										After the last post, the car was almost ready for the Dixie
										National tour, held in Cecil Georgia, but there was some
										final prep to do. I took the car down to Solo Performance to
										corner weight and align the thing, with good results.
									</p>

										Total empty weight was with all loose items removed (spare

										additional weight to mimic driver.
									</p>

									<p>&nbsp;</p>

									<h3>St. Louis Region Test &amp; Tune</h3>

									<p>
										The corner weight/alignment was completed just in time for
										the St. Louis region’s impromptu Test &amp; Tune. The
										weather didn’t pan out well, cold and wet, but the region
										did a great job of throwing together a last minute T&amp;T
										at Gateway Motorsports Park on March 13th.&nbsp; Due to the
										weather, not much was done in terms of actually testing and
										tuning, I used the event as a driver shakedown to try to get
										the winter rust out of my head, I also used it as a trial
										test of towing the car behind the 2008 Tahoe.
									</p>

									<h3>Dixie National Tour</h3>

									<p>
										For the Dixie National Tour, Natalie and I towed the car
										down to Georgia (<a
											href="http://izzyscustomcages.com/"
											target="_blank"
											>thanks to Izzy’s for the trailer</a
										>). We went down a couple of days early to spend a day with
										one of my bosses hiking through
										<a
											href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154059936489703&amp;set=a.230948829702.168653.685999702&amp;type=3&amp;permPage=1"
											target="_blank"
											>beautiful Amicalola Falls State Park</a
										>. After the hike and staying a night in the cabin, we
										headed down through Atlanta. I don’t know if I have ever had
										a good time driving through Atlanta, and this trip was
										probably the worst in terms of our experiences. Waze took us
										through downtown, getting off the highway, to try to avoid
										some of the accidents on the highway, but Waze obviously
										didn’t know we were pulling a car on a trailer, because the
										route was definitely not ideal for the rig.
									</p>

									<p>
										We ended up in Valdosta Georgia a day earlier then planned,
										which ended up making things much easier on us Friday when
										we got up, washed the car, and headed out to the event site,
										the South Georgia Motorsports Park. Friday morning we
										parked, unloaded the car and headed over to the practice
										course to try to get more of the rust off (the driver).
										Practice went pretty well, though it was crazy busy, so long
										waits between the practice runs. Brian (former car owner)
										ended up taking some runs as well as he was going to be
										co-driving with me for the Dixie Tour. After practice runs I
										made Natalie head out for a bicycle ride with me, it was our
										first time experiencing riding for your life while being
										chased by some very angry dogs. Other than the dogs, the
										ride was flat, fast and great exercise.

									<p>
										Saturday and Sunday for the Tour went well. Saturday morning
										started out wet, we ran first heat, but it was drying, so
										there was definitely an advantage to being second driver if
										you had two drivers, as the surface was getting dryer/faster
										every additional run. At the end of Saturday runs I was
										sitting in second place in the 7 driver STU class. Brian was
										sitting in the 3rd and final trophy spot. Sunday we both
										drove well, all driver’s in the heat benefited from dry
										runs. Both of us ended up falling back, myself one position
										to finish third (final trophy spot) and Brian back two, to
										fifth for the weekend. I was pleased with the result, and
										happy to finally have fun in the car, I was beginning to
										worry I wasn’t going to enjoy autocrossing this 350z after
										the first two events I had done in it.
									</p>

									<h3>Post Dixie National Tour</h3>

									<p>
										From Dixie, the car was loaded up on the trailer and headed
										to Chattanooga (with Brian), while Natalie and I headed
										south to Orlando for a few days at a work convention. On the
										way back up to Chattanooga on Thursday morning to get the
										car, Brian sent me a txt telling me that someone had
										attempted to break into the car while it was sitting on the
										trailer at his shop. Somehow they were unsuccessful at
										getting in, but they did manage to bang up the driver’s door
										and window (about $1500-2,000 worth of damage).

									<h3>Jack Daniel’s</h3>

									<p>
										The drive back through Atlanta was fun again, lots of
										accidents and idiots, along with the fact that I had the
										news about the car, it wasn’t a very fun day. We picked the
										car up and drove up to Tullahoma to stay the night, before
										heading to the Jack Daniel’s distillery on Friday morning.

									<h3>St. Louis Region Event #1</h3>

									<p>
										The first local SCCA autocross in St. Louis was held on
										Sunday April 3, 2016. Over all the event went okay, I won
										the STU class by a couple of seconds, but ended up in 7th on
										the overall index. Not exactly the position I was hoping
										for. The car drove well, I feel like I just didn’t drive it
										to the full extent of how it can be driven, and my position
										on Index showed that result.

									<h3>Local Event #2</h3>

									<p>
										Event #2 of the St. Louis 2016 series was held this past
										Sunday at the Family Arena in St. Charles. Once again, I
										finished on top in the STU class, but this time in 8th
										overall on Index. Again, there was more in the car, though I
										don’t know if there was a full 1.2 seconds more, which is
										what I would have needed to move in front of the STF index
										winner.

									<h3>Tire Pressures and Shock Settings</h3>

									<p>
										My current tire pressures I’ve been running on the RE-71Rs
										is 31F/29R
									</p>

									<p>Front Shocks at 9 clicks</p>

									<p>
										Rear shocks at 1 full rotation (can’t get the darn clicks
										working on the back)
									</p>

									<h3>Trying out SoloStorm</h3>

									<p>
										One thing I will be doing this year is trying to improve my
										driving. I find that overall my instincts are “pretty” good
										as to where I can go fast, and where I can’t, my gut gets me
										pretty far. But I honestly don’t think it gets me far
										enough. I have a hard time “improving” on autocross runs
										typically, meaning I’ll go out and put down a pretty quick
										time, but not improve much over the next 2 runs (more if
										local events), which means I am oftentimes not getting all
										that I should be out of the car, or myself. I am going to
										try to improve my driving through the use of technology, and
										the hot tool right now for that in Autocross is an Android
										app called
										<a
											href="http://www.petreldata.com/product/solostorm-gps-obd-ii-and-video-logger-for-android-v2-2/"
											target="_blank"
											>SoloStorm</a
										>, from
										<a href="http://www.petreldata.com/" target="_blank"
											>petreldata.com</a
										>.
									</p>
									<p>
										With SoloStorm you can analyze the data from your runs
										quickly from an Android tablet inside of your car. In the
										past I’ve tried to look at data from the DL-1, on a laptop,
										between runs, but it was clunky and not easy enough to do
										that quickly. With SoloStorm you are able to look at runs,
										segments, and compare where you are faster or slower, this
										can be extremely useful when you have two drivers as you can
										compare your run to the other driver to see where you can
										each improve.
									</p>
									<p>
										I haven’t used it just yet, I did try to get it working with
										my old-ass RaceTechnology DL-1, but wasn’t able to get the
										Tablet (Nexus 7 2013) and the DL-1 talking properly while on
										the parking lot at the Family Arena. I’m hoping to have the
										Bluetooth GPS&nbsp; hardware before my next event (<a
											href="http://www.gatewayautox.com"
											>www.gatewayautox.com</a
										>) so look for more posts on SoloStorm in the coming weeks
										and months.
									</p>

									<h3>What’s Next?</h3>

									<p>
										Next weekend (April 30, May 1st) I’ll be at the Grissom
										Classic in Peru Indiana, and the following weekend I’ll be
										at the Wilmington ProSolo. See you out at an event!
