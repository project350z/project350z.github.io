I took some time this evening to take photographs of what I have and what I am trying to sell. Right now I am trying to sell everything locally so prices don&rsquo;t include any shipping. If I don&rsquo;t have any interest locally I&rsquo;m willing to ship the coilovers/springs/shocks but only as a package.</span></p>  <p>Sway bars and the exhaust are way too much of a hassle to try to ship, so those are local only. (Local in the San Francisco Bay Area, if you&rsquo;re somewhere else in California and want to drive here, feel free).</p>  <p><strong>Cash Only, no checks. Paypal acceptable for a hold, but cash must be delivered in full before handover of the parts. All parts located in Half Moon Bay, contact me at z &ndash; at &ndash; christoc.com for more info.</strong></p>  <p>All parts are sold as is, with no warranty, and unknown mileage. I can tell you I put about 10k on each of them (except the control arms and the Cobb bar), but am not sure what they had prior to me.</p>  <p><a href="http://www.project350z.com/Articles/itemId/550/For-Sale-4-18x10quot-38-Enkei-RPF1-w-710s.aspx">I&rsquo;m also still selling the 18x10&rdquo; Enkei RPF1s over on my other post</a>.</p>  <h2>350z BSP Suspension $1200</h2>  <p>$1200, All four corners, no sway bars. </p>  <p><strong>Front Suspension</strong>     <br />  TrueChoice Phase 4 coilovers     <br />  650lb Hyperco Springs</p>  <p><strong>Rear Suspension</strong>     <br />  Unknown brand spring perches     <br />  Unknown brand 500lb springs     <br />  Koni Sport Shocks (standard off the shelf)</p>  <p><img alt="350z Suspension For Sale" src="http://christoc.com/350z/6745562429_fbd8410816.jpg" /></p>  <h2>350z Sway Bars (Hotchkis Front/Rear $200, Cobb Front $125) SOLD</h2>  <p>$200 Set of Hotchkis Front/Rear Adjustable Sway Bars, no bushings, no end links (I used the stock ones)</p>  <p><img alt="" src="http://christoc.com/350z/6745567129_f709b51d7f.jpg" /></p>  <p>$125 Cobb 35mm Front Sway Bar (bushings included, but no end links)</p>  <p><img alt="" src="http://christoc.com/350z/6745571243_2e6ed164bf.jpg" /></p>  <h2>Injen Super SES Dual Exhaust <span style="font-weight: bold;">$500 SOLD</span></h2>  <p>$500 Used exhaust, works and sounds great.
