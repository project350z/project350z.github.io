<p>So the 2010 Autocross season is starting up soon, and here in Colorado the winter series is running strong. I had a little incident with the <a href="http://www.projectquattro.com" target="_blank">projectquattro</a> a few weeks ago, which also has spurred along the motivation to get a 350z.</p>  <p>I&rsquo;ve been monitoring Craigslist here locally for a while now, and it appears that there is a wide variety of 350zs available here around Denver right now. We went north about an hour this afternoon to check out one in particular. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/sets/72157623108242515/" target="_blank">Check out the photos that I took of the car</a>.</p>  <p>It&rsquo;s a 2004 Enthusiast model, with an Injen SES Exhaust, a Nismo short shifter, 18&rdquo; wheels off a Performance model and a few other mods. Because it was Sunday we didn&rsquo;t get to look in the car, except through the windows, or under the hood. I&rsquo;m hoping to possibly drive back up there one evening this week to take a look and test drive of the car. </p>  <p>To speed up the purchasing process I&rsquo;m hoping to get rid of the 240z soon, if you&rsquo;re interested in a <a href="http://www.project240z.com/" target="_blank">1973 Datsun 240z check out the site</a>!</p>  <p>I&rsquo;ll be updating the website here over the next couple weeks as hopefully things ramp up!</p>
