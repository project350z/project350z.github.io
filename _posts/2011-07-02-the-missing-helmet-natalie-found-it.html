<p>Over a year ago I realized that my Bell Helmet was missing. Somewhere on the move from Colorado to California it went off into its own world.</p>

<p>I was sure I had it with me when I came in March 2010, and must have left it in a hotel while I was shifting around hotels for a few weeks while looking for a place to live. I went through box after box after box when we moved all our stuff from Colorado to CA in April, but no matter where I dug I couldn’t find it.</p>

<p>Then last month we moved again, this time only 20 miles or so away, but I figured I would find the helmet if it were still around during that move. I was wrong. I found nothing.</p>

<p>Until today, Natalie was going through boxes of pictures with her mother (visiting for the weekend) and in one of the boxes labeled Picture Frames, she found the helmet!</p>

<p>I’ll have to take a picture of the Bell later this weekend, I can’t find one digging through old photos, but I did come across some photos from the day I picked up my 2003 350z.</p>

<p>Here’s a photo of the 350z, and the 1999 Z-28 Camaro I traded in when I purchased it.</p> <a title="My 350z and my Camaro by chrishammond, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/5893276184/"><img alt="My 350z and my Camaro" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5064/5893276184_d938cdcd93_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" /></a>
