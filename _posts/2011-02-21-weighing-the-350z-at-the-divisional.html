<p>So there&rsquo;s been much debate (or really just many people telling me I am crazy) over on SCCAForums in the thread I started to discuss the proposed move of the 350z from BSP to ESP in SCCA Autocross classing.</p>

<p>Ever since the 350z was released I thought it was the perfect F-Stock car, though others have always seemed to think otherwise and it was relegated to B-Stock where all but a few events it became an also ran behind the RX-8. It was also classed in BSP (b street prepared) where it hasn&rsquo;t faired any better for the last 8 years. Last month the SCCA posted a proposal to move the 350z from BSP to ESP, I&rsquo;m all for the move, most of the ESP folk apparently aren&rsquo;t, &ldquo;A Japanese car in our American Car Class? How dare you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alright, so no one has made that complaint, but the way they &ldquo;defend&rdquo; their ground they might as well be drawing lines in the soil. There&rsquo;s much debate about what a 350z will actually weight in SP trim, my car isn&rsquo;t fully SP prepped yet (and to be honest that will likely take 2-3 years due to budget) but I figured I would go ahead and weigh the car at the divisional event today.</p>

<p>First things first, here are the details of the car itself (if it's not mentioned it is stock)   <br />  2004 Nissan 350z "Enthusiast" package    <br />  18x10" RPF1s    <br />  305 V710s    <br />  No stereo/speakers    <br />  ~2 gallons of gas    <br />  Injen Super SES dual exhaust (weighed at 15lbs lighter than stock)    <br />  HFCs    <br />  K&amp;N CAI    <br />  Plenum spacer    <br />  Hotchkis F/R sway bars    <br />  No spare tire, tools, or rear carpeting/mats(not fastened down from the factory)</p>

<p>And what did it weigh in at?</p>

<p><strong>3062lbs</strong></p>

<p>That matches up fairly closely to my 2003 Enthusiast I had from 03-06 in b-stock trim. A few other mods on this one, though the old one had a lighter exhaust setup. The 2003 weighed 3075lbs.</p>
