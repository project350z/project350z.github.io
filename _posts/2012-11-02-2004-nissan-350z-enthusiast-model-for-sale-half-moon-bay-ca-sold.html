<h2>(SOLD)</h2>  The time is nearing for when the 350z must be sold, so if you are interested hit me up 2004 350z Enthusiast, &lt;75k miles, currently sits stock other than a K&amp;N CAI and a Plenum spacer, and a grounding kit (installed by previous owner).<br />  <br />  Also has a receiver mounted to the rear bumper that I use for a bike rack.<br />  <br />  The car is well maintained, looks great with lower than usual wear and tear of an 8 year old car.<br />  <br />  I also have the suspension still in boxes, see previous posts for more details, but TrueChoice Koni DAs up front and SA Koni Sports in the rear with springs/perches for the rear. This will be sold separate from the car, unless the buyer wants it for additional $$.<br />  <br />  Car is located in Half Moon Bay, CA, and available for purchase at $9,000, if you want the suspension throw in another grand and you can have it all.<br />
