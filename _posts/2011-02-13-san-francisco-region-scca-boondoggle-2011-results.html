<p>So today was the first day for a few things</p>  <ol>      <li>It was my first time running an autocross with the San Francisco Region of the SCCA. I must say things went fairly well, even with of the normal first event hiccups. </li>      <li>It was my first time running this 350z on RComps, and any 350z on 18&rdquo; tires on 10&rdquo; wide wheels. Overall I was impressed, though I long for 315 Hoosier A6s!</li>  </ol>  <p>Today&rsquo;s event was held at California&rsquo;s Great America in Santa Clara, CA. I started out slow, but finally kicked it in gear a bit on my 4th and final run. I realized today that I used to drive balls to the wall all the time at an autocross, I guess in my old age I&rsquo;m not doing that as much, so it took me a while to turn that switch back on.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s video of my first run, 42.7** seconds, 2 cones. Check out some of that inside tire spin, a definite sign that I need to get a new LSD.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s my fourth run, I wish I had adjusted the rear camera a bit better, but I can&rsquo;t change that now.</p>

<p>I was shooting video with the <a href="http://www.chasecam.com" target="_blank">ChaseCam</a> and my original GoPro, my GoPro HD had some issues and no longer works. I&rsquo;m hoping I can get a replacement for it ASAP as next weekend is a two day divisional also being held at Great America, though fortunately this time on a bigger lot, today was awful cramped mid day when all the second session drivers and first session drivers were trying to park and such.</p>

<p>So how did I end up for the day? Well, I was running in the Index ( X ) class, and I got stomped! I finished 17 out of 22 in the class, 41st or so overall on the event index. I think I would have been in 3rd place out of 6 had I been running BSP with the regular class.</p>
