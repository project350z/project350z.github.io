<p>I was going to do a blog post on ChrisHammond.com tonight with a video embedded that I took at the NASA Ames Research Center tweetup, but unfortunately the video I produced came out at 800mb and between youtube and my connection it doesn’t look like that video is going to be ready for the public to view tonight.</p>

<p>So instead I’m going to post here on Project350z.com. Why? Well in last night’s post I mentioned that the Lug Nuts I picked up from Five Point Tire Imports wouldn’t fit in the wheels for the car. So today I went by there again (after the tweetup) and replaced the lug nuts with ones that should fit on the car just fine.</p>

<p>I did some reading tonight, and dug around in my service manual, so that I can get the car into the garage in the morning and start installing the new longer studs (after removing the OEM shorter studs).</p>

<p>I also picked up a second GoProHD battery pack today, so if I run out of juice on the GoPro tomorrow while working on the car I should be able to swap it easily and extend my recording.</p>
