<p>So begins the latest project, <a href="http://www.projectquattro.com" target="_blank">Projectquattro.com</a> has been disposed of, after the incident a few weeks ago, where it took out a light pole, it was time for the car to go. I ended up not getting
    it repaired, it was actually going to cost just less than we originally paid for it, so instead, we traded it in tonight!</p>

<p>Woot!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m back in autocross mode with a 2004 Nissan 350Z Enthusiast, and here she is.</p>

<p>You might think, hey, wait a minute, isn&rsquo;t that the same car you had back when? Well, not quite. My previous 350z was a 2003 Enthusiast. What&rsquo;s the difference? Well between 2k3 and 2k4, not much, 2k4 I believe is less buggy, the only physical
    difference i know of is that the 2004 has pads next to your leg on the center console, and a power plug under the passenger side of the dashboard.</p>

<p>Now, the differences between my old 2003 and my new 2004, here they are (differences as of time of purchase of the 2004, and time of sale of the 2003).</p>

<p>So what comes next? Well, more modifications to get the car ready for the STR Street Touring Roadster class in the SCCA. When I&rsquo;ll get to all those I&rsquo;m not sure. I&rsquo;m going to try to go over the car thoroughly tomorrow in the garage,
    see if there are any other custom parts I don&rsquo;t know about. At some point in the coming weeks I&rsquo;ll come up with a list of things I need to get done to the car before the full blown autocross season starts up.</p>

<p>Also tomorrow I&rsquo;ve got a guy coming to take a look at the <a href="http://www.project240z.com" target="_blank">Project240z</a>. I would like to keep that, but I know I shouldn&rsquo;t, I won&rsquo;t ever get it finished, especially now that I have
    this 350z!</p>

<p>On January 30th I&rsquo;m going to take the <a href="http://www.project350z.com/" target="_blank">Project350z</a> out to its first Autocross.</p>
