# Do I need to try on my helmet? 
Trying on your helmet is important, you want to make sure what you select fits you properly, and is comfortable. You'll be wearing it for a long time, so you want to make sure it's comfortable. You also shouldn't just buy the cheapest helmet you can find, but what you can afford. We're talking about protecting your noggin, I assume that is important to you.

# What brand helmet do I need?
Brand specifics will obviously vary, do you need/want the most expensive coolest looking helmet? Or do you need the one that does the job the best? My recommendation is you try on multiple brands and see which one feels best, and meets your budget.

# Can I buy a helmet online?
Absolutely you can buy a helmet online. [SoloPerformance.com](https://soloperformance.com/collections/helmets-and-accessories) has one of the largest selections of helmets online, they sell hundreds of helmets a year.
