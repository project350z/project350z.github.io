<p>So as I try to get ready for the 2011 autocross season I stopped into a tire shop the other day, the Les Schwab on El Camino in San Carlos, California.</p>  <p>I was curious how much they would charge to mount and balance for 18” tires. For those of you who don’t autocross, it is very common for autocrossers to need a local tire changing service, while not purchasing the tires from that location as well.</p>  <p>I’ve had placed charge anywhere from $60 to $80. When I asked Les Schwab what they would charge he told me $149, I literally laughed, said thank you, and walked out.</p>  <p>I’ll be tasked now with finding a local shop who will hopefully do it for cheaper. I was spoiled in St. Louis, I had access to the tire machine at <a href="http://www.soloperformance.com">www.soloperformance.com</a>, I had a % share in the machine, actually I still do. It might be cheaper just to ship wheels and tires to Dave and have him mount them.</p>  <p>Getting them shipped back though might make that cost prohibitive <img style="border-bottom-style: none; border-right-style: none; border-top-style: none; border-left-style: none" class="wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-smile" alt="Smile" src="http://www.project350z.com/Portals/4/PublishThumbnails/Windows-Live-Writer/38c1eaeeaf3c_1076/wlEmoticon-smile_2.png" /></p>  <p>Anyone got any leads to a good tire mounting shop on the peninsula in&#160; the San Francisco Bay Area?</p>
