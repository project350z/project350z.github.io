<p>So today was the first time I’ve ever autocrossed in California, and the first time the car has seen an event since our runs at the Colorado event in January. I left San Carlos early in the morning and headed off to pick up <a href="http://www.willstrohl.com" target="_blank">Will Strohl</a>. We headed down to Marina California for the <a href="http://www.norcalufo.org/main/" target="_blank">Northern California United Five-Ten Owners Club</a> </p>  <p>We headed south towards Marina, and decided we wanted to try to grab some food, unfortunately we didn’t have much luck finding anything, and ended up going a different way than Google Maps originally said. Though, to be honest, I think we went a better way, we headed down 101 to 156, and bypassed the hills/mountains over towards Santa Cruz. We were there before the gates opened, and when they did we were two of the first people there.</p>  <p>We walked the course as typical at an autocross to get a feel for where you were supposed to drive during the event. I ended up working the first heat, and running the third, so while I was busy working Strohl sat around watching, shot a little video, and texted with his significant other to keep himself entertained.</p>  <p>When it came time to run in the third heat Will helped me get the car ready, and I was <a href="http://twitpic.com/2sa58u" target="_blank">ready to line up</a>. I went out on my first run by myself, with the plan to see the course completely and try not to make a fool of myself when the second run came up and Will came along for a ride. Here’s the video from my first run, unfortunately I seem to have picked up an old habit from my past autocross days. My first run was my fastest for the day.</p>  <p></p>  <div style="padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; float: none; padding-top: 0px" id="scid:5737277B-5D6D-4f48-ABFC-DD9C333F4C5D:7898c48b-1c8d-48df-8930-2e05bc9d3231" class="wlWriterEditableSmartContent"><div id="5f8278a9-5e8d-4d61-a6e1-77d885b857cd" style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; display: inline;"><div><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95ItS4Shce8&amp;feature=youtube_gdata_player" target="_new"><img src="http://www.project350z.com/Portals/4/PublishThumbnails/WindowsLiveWriter/278347fa8f0f_12E23/video136b409b2f0b.jpg" style="border-style: none" galleryimg="no" onload="var downlevelDiv = document.getElementById('5f8278a9-5e8d-4d61-a6e1-77d885b857cd'); downlevelDiv.innerHTML = &quot;&lt;div&gt;&lt;object width=\&quot;425\&quot; height=\&quot;355\&quot;&gt;&lt;param name=\&quot;movie\&quot; value=\&quot;http://www.youtube.com/v/95ItS4Shce8&amp;hl=en\&quot;&gt;&lt;\/param&gt;&lt;embed src=\&quot;http://www.youtube.com/v/95ItS4Shce8&amp;hl=en\&quot; type=\&quot;application/x-shockwave-flash\&quot; width=\&quot;425\&quot; height=\&quot;355\&quot;&gt;&lt;\/embed&gt;&lt;\/object&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;&quot;;" alt=""></a></div></div></div>  <p></p>  <p>And now for the fun part of it, check this video out of Will Strohl on his first ride along, my second run. </p>  <p></p>  <div style="padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; float: none; padding-top: 0px" id="scid:5737277B-5D6D-4f48-ABFC-DD9C333F4C5D:fc34a410-8567-4593-9ca1-d33a5b290d29" class="wlWriterEditableSmartContent"><div id="a87855b8-892a-486c-9ad7-b21b6a493e75" style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; display: inline;"><div><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oW3_lPi4I_0&amp;feature=youtube_gdata_player" target="_new"><img src="http://www.project350z.com/Portals/4/PublishThumbnails/WindowsLiveWriter/278347fa8f0f_12E23/video0a8f90584a83.jpg" style="border-style: none" galleryimg="no" onload="var downlevelDiv = document.getElementById('a87855b8-892a-486c-9ad7-b21b6a493e75'); downlevelDiv.innerHTML = &quot;&lt;div&gt;&lt;object width=\&quot;425\&quot; height=\&quot;355\&quot;&gt;&lt;param name=\&quot;movie\&quot; value=\&quot;http://www.youtube.com/v/oW3_lPi4I_0&amp;hl=en\&quot;&gt;&lt;\/param&gt;&lt;embed src=\&quot;http://www.youtube.com/v/oW3_lPi4I_0&amp;hl=en\&quot; type=\&quot;application/x-shockwave-flash\&quot; width=\&quot;425\&quot; height=\&quot;355\&quot;&gt;&lt;\/embed&gt;&lt;\/object&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;&quot;;" alt=""></a></div></div></div>  <p></p>  <p>Overall the event was just so so for me. It was good to be back and autocrossing, though i was disappointed with my performance. I ran in BSP for the event, or at least I think I did, the event organization was a little different than I am used to having run primarily SCCA events for most of my autocross career. I don’t know what the end results are for the event, everything was done on paper, so I imagine it will be a few days before the results are actually posted.</p>  <p>What I did learn, or remember, is that running the 350z on street tires is not fun! Now I need to figure out what I’m really going to do with this car. We’ve got a kid coming, VERY SOON, so I need to find something that I can drive that is kid friendly, though I hope to not have to get rid of the 350z. I hope to get to autocross again in the next couple months, we will see. </p>  <p>I’m thinking that this car might be fun to play with in SSM, but that might entail a turbo and lots of other toys!</p>  <p>I took a number of photos at the event, here are some of me, and then the <a href="http://www.project350z.com/Photos/view/setdisplay/setid/72157624917119301.aspx" target="_blank">full Flickr Set</a>.</p>  <p><a title="IMG_6233" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/17726343@N00/5028892990/"><img border="0" alt="IMG_6233" src="http://static.flickr.com/4083/5028892990_cf3c425755_m.jpg" /></a><a title="IMG_6225" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/17726343@N00/5028275443/"><img border="0" alt="IMG_6225" src="http://static.flickr.com/4091/5028275443_f27b042640_m.jpg" /></a><a title="IMG_6221" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/17726343@N00/5028890414/"><img border="0" alt="IMG_6221" src="http://static.flickr.com/4130/5028890414_7988799ccb_m.jpg" /></a><a title="IMG_6220" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/17726343@N00/5028889402/"><img border="0" alt="IMG_6220" src="http://static.flickr.com/4088/5028889402_99dbc9bc2e_m.jpg" /></a><a title="IMG_6217" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/17726343@N00/5028271819/"><img border="0" alt="IMG_6217" src="http://static.flickr.com/4110/5028271819_3a2cb49499_m.jpg" /></a><a title="IMG_6215" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/17726343@N00/5028270725/"><img border="0" alt="IMG_6215" src="http://static.flickr.com/4149/5028270725_e638b419aa_m.jpg" /></a></p>
