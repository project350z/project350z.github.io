<p>So here we are, at the end of May 2011, and it’s time to figure out if I’m going to the 2011 Tire Rack SCCA Solo National Championships in late August.</p>  <p>Originally I was planning on taking the 350z, but lately I’ve been thinking that I probably won’t/can’t/shouldn’t due to a number of factors, mainly budget, but time, and family. With a new baby, taking off to Lincoln Nebraska for a week (or more) is a rather costly affair. I can’t exactly put Natalie and the baby in the 350z and make the drive, and making the drive with the 350z, towing a trailer for tires, and having Natalie and the baby drive in the CX-7 isn’t ideal either.</p>  <p>So I have a couple of options. </p>  <ul>   <li>Don’t go (least expensive option, also least fun) </li>    <li>Drive myself in the 350z, have Natalie and baby fly out (requires airline ticket, and rental car) </li>    <li>Drive myself in the 350z and have Natalie and baby stay home </li>    <li>Fly to Lincoln and codrive with someone else </li> </ul>  <p>What to do, what to do?</p>
