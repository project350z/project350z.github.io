<p>So I finally heard back from SPL Pars regarding an email I sent a few weeks ago. I emailed them to ask if they could provide me the information on what the arms are configured for in terms of the heim joints.</p>

<p>In summary of the <a href="http://www.project350z.com/Articles/itemId/509/The-suspension-is-here-Now-to-fix-it.aspx" target="_blank">previous blog post</a>, the heim joints aren’t legal in B Street Prepared (or any street prepared class in the SCCA). So these arms aren’t legal.</p>

<p>SPL finally responded with</p>  <blockquote>   <p>the rod end thread on our arms is 5/8&quot;-18 right hand, the width of the bearing w/ spacers is 1.96&quot; and bore size is 10mm.</p> </blockquote>  <p>Now the question is, can I come up with something that will work to replace those that will be legal in BSP? I doubt it, but it’s worth looking. Right now I am running the OEM Control arms modified with some custom offset bushings.</p>
