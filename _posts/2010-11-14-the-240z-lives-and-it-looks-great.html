<p>So it&rsquo;s been a while since I&rsquo;ve blogged here on Project240z.com, reason being that I sold the car quite a while ago. Back this summer I got an email from a guy telling me he was the new owner, having purchased it from the guy that I sold it to.</p>

<p>Then, a couple weeks ago I got these in my inbox:</p>

<p>I cried a little bit. The car looks great, it has a motor in it, and it even has license plates! </p>

<p>I&rsquo;m glad he sent them to be, but it definitely makes me sad, to see the car up and running, all one color, I had it 4 years and never had it looking that good! Great work, I hope to hear more about the car in the future.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m still debating what is going on with the 350z, one day I want to trade it and get an EVO or STI, other days I want to keep it and put a turbo on it. We&rsquo;ll see, for now I imagine it will stick around because we&rsquo;ve got a lot of other things going on and the budget doesn&rsquo;t necessarily allow for a turbo AWD right now.</p>
