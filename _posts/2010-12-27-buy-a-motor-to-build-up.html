<p>So I am not sure where the 350z is ultimately headed. I think SSM in SCCA Autocross could be fun, though that will take some time and a lot of money to do.</p>  <p>I was thinking, perhaps a motor build up would be a place to start. And rather than build up a turbo motor from what I currently have, keep it as is and find another motor to build up.</p>  <p>There’s a guy selling one on My350z that is somewhat local, could be an interesting thing to pull into the garage. Though, considering we got rid of the pickup truck last week it might not be a good idea to acquire a new motor just yet <img style="border-bottom-style: none; border-right-style: none; border-top-style: none; border-left-style: none" class="wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-smile" alt="Smile" src="http://www.project350z.com/Portals/4/PublishThumbnails/Windows-Live-Writer/Buy-a-motor-to-build-up_14372/wlEmoticon-smile_2.png" /></p>  <p><a href="http://my350z.com/forum/norcal-marketplace/467754-fs-rev-up-motor-w-spun-bearing.html">http://my350z.com/forum/norcal-marketplace/467754-fs-rev-up-motor-w-spun-bearing.html</a></p>  <p>I may email him and tell him I’ll give him $150, see where that goes.</p>
