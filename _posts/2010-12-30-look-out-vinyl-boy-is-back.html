<p>So it has been over 2 years since I’ve had vinyl on a car, that will be changing in 2011. Look out for the upcoming transformation of the Project 350z! Early in the year I will be doing a minor overhaul, with the goal of doing a full wrap on the car later in the year.</p>  <p>I just need to find someone local who can do the wrap for a reasonable cost, and make sure that they don’t damage the car in the process. I’ve not had anyone apply vinyl to my cars before, I’ve always done it myself, but I don’t have visions of being able to do a full wrap myself. </p>  <p>For a refresher, here are some photos of some of my past vinyl experiences (all self applied)</p>  <p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/2768918509/"><img border="0" alt="The new look" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3182/2768918509_72f218deef_t.jpg" width="100" height="40" /></a>&#160;<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/2291945232/"><img border="0" alt="DotNetNuke Corvette" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2402/2291945232_3f7d42f74a_t.jpg" width="100" height="67" /></a>&#160;<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/1282983712/"><img border="0" alt="My Old 350Z" src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1207/1282983712_98de77fd22_t.jpg" width="100" height="67" /></a>&#160;<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/3257269658/"><img border="0" alt="350Z Autocross" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3261/3257269658_078fbcd902_t.jpg" width="100" height="67" /></a>&#160;<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/4116230997/"><img border="0" alt="CRW_8435" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2520/4116230997_ebe11d2719_t.jpg" width="100" height="67" /></a>&#160;<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/2063988267/"><img border="0" alt="My Old Camaro" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2232/2063988267_51055763a0_t.jpg" width="100" height="75" /></a>&#160;<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/4142941262/"><img border="0" alt="7G9X4944" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2659/4142941262_30e670dbc7_t.jpg" width="100" height="67" /></a></p>
