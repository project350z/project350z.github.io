Instead of even trying to repair the wheel I ordered another one from NLMotoring, it was $165 shipped, so it just made sense to order a new one than to worry about another repair weakening the wheel even further and constantly working about it leaking in the future. </p> <p>These wheels aren’t what I would choose if money weren’t an option, but money is always a factor in racing, and these are the wheels that came with the car, so they will have to do until I get some <a href="http://www.soloperformance.com/CCW-Wheels_c_747.html" target="_blank">CCW Wheels from SPS</a>.</p> <p>Here’s what the 350z looks like on the XXR 531 18”x11” in Chromium Black, they do look pretty darn good for a wheel that you can get for $165 shipped.</p><a title="Project350z lit by Sunrise (350z XXR 531 18x11)" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/22872425712/in/album-72157660216095268/" data-footer="true" data-flickr-embed="true"><img alt="Project350z lit by Sunrise (350z XXR 531 18x11)" src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/750/22872425712_dfd70644be_b.jpg" width="100%"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
