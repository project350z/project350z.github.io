<p>It was a good weekend on the 350z, I made progress on pretty much everything I needed/wanted to do to start the 2016 season, with only the corner balance and wheel alignment remaining. Those are scheduled for Monday at <a href="http://SoloPerformance.com"
    target="_blank">Solo Performance</a><sub></sub>.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a run down of what I was able to accomplish this weekend:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Oil/Filter Change</li>
    <li>Plenum Spacer Removel</li>
    <li>Upper and Lower intake manifold cleaning</li>
    <li>Lower engine splash guard installed</li>
    <li>Passenger front fender liner replaced</li>
    <li>Replaced bolts for strut tower brace</li>
    <li>PlastiDip&rsquo;d strut tower brace</li>
    <li>Replaced missing plastic clips all around the front end, top and bottom</li>
</ul>
<p>When I removed the upper intake, to remove the Plenum spacer I found that the inside was a disgusting mess. I sprayed it with some carb cleaner before seeing &ldquo;not recommended on fuel injected vehicles&rdquo; on the can, so I headed off to pick up
    some throttle body/intake cleaner. Ideally I would have taken the entire lower manifold off and cleaned it, but I didn&rsquo;t have the lower gasket and after spending all day on the car I was anxious to finish up for the evening. I cleaned it up,
    but it still could be better (See photos below). After getting it all back together, I wasn&rsquo;t able to start the car, initially it started and ran for a moment, but after that it wouldn&rsquo;t fire.</p>

<p>I went to bed dejected, worried I had done something to damage the car. While laying in bed I started to question if I had reconnected the throttle body, so first thing in the morning when I awoke I went out to the garage to check, and sure enough, I
    hadn&rsquo;t fully connected the throttle body. I connected that up, and later in the morning after grabbing the keys I was able to start the car up without any problems.</p>

<p>In addition to the work on the 2003 350z, I also spent a bit of time working on a friend&rsquo;s 2014 Corvette Stingray. He&rsquo;s had it for 2 years now, with just over 6k miles on it, and after the brakes get warmed up it has a pretty annoying squeal/squeak
    that happens during low speed stops. He&rsquo;s had the service bulletin for &lsquo;14s done but that didn&rsquo;t help with the brake noise, so I have the car for a week or two to try and correct it. After being able to reproduce the problem, I determined
    that it appeared to be coming from the rear of the car. I took the rear pads off, applied some anti-squeal to the back of the pads and then drove it 100 miles this weekend around town, so far it appears that the problem has been resolved, but I&rsquo;ll
    drive it a few more times before he returns to see if it is truly fixed.</p>
