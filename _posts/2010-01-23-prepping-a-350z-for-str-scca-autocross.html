<p>My initial intentions with this new (to me) 350z is to run in the newly formed STR class. This is a street tire class, meaning 140 treadwear or greater, which differs from the Stock Classes, which technically run &ldquo;street legal&rdquo; tires, but are often treadwear 50 or less. </p>

<p>STR also allows for a number of other modifications, over time I&rsquo;m going to be slowly prepping the car for the class, hopefully finalizing everything by the end of the autocross year, in time for Nationals in Lincoln, Nebraska.</p>

<p>As I blog about the prep work for the car I&rsquo;ll <a href="http://www.project350z.com/Articles/tags/STR.aspx" target="_blank">tag the posts with &ldquo;STR&rdquo;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve started by reading a couple of threads over on that website&nbsp; I used to manage, SCCAForums.com. <a href="http://sccaforums.com/forums/1/370386/ShowThread.aspx" target="_blank">The first is a thread from &ldquo;NelsonI&rdquo;</a>, it has input from a number of different people, some you can trust, some you can&rsquo;t, but generally good feedback. I&rsquo;ll start blogging over the next few months about the some of the aspects of that post, and what I decide with the various parts and setup for the car.<br />  <br />  <strong>UPDATE: I am not longer building for STR, I am now building for BSP</strong></p>
