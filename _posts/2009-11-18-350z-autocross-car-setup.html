<p>Running in BS (B-Stock) for three years I learned a lot about the 350Z and the setup for the car. While I don't currently still have that car, I will go ahead and create a post about the setup of the car for BS.</p>  <p><strong>Car:</strong> 2003 Nissan 350Z Enthusiast</p>  <p><strong>Options:</strong> Aluminum Door plates</p>  <p><strong>Wheels:</strong> Enkie RP-F1</p>  <p><strong>Tires:</strong> Hoosier Autocross tires</p>  <p><strong>Shocks:</strong> Koni Double-adjustable sport shocks (from Nissan Motorsport)</p>  <p><strong>Configuration:</strong>&nbsp;Empty fuel tank, spare tire and all carpet removed from rear</p>  <p><strong>Weight:</strong>&nbsp;~3075lbs.</p>  <p><strong>Alignment:</strong>&nbsp;Camber FL -0.7degrees FR -1.2degrees RL -2.0degrees RR -2.0degrees</p>  <p>Toe FL -.08degrees FR -.10degrees RL -0.01degrees RR 0.03degrees</p>  <p>Some of these values might be off, it has been three years since I owned the car ;) I'm working on trying to get all my old information together about the car.</p>  <div>&nbsp;</div>
