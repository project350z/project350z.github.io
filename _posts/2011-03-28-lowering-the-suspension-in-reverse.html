<p>So today I went back at the suspension of the car. </p>  <div style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px; display: inline; float: none;" id="scid:5737277B-5D6D-4f48-ABFC-DD9C333F4C5D:27f760f4-e264-409c-bf6f-d8050b9351d7" class="wlWriterEditableSmartContent">  <div id="06664982-00b5-4b57-bb3c-d3de804b9977" style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; display: inline;">  <div><object width="448" height="252">  <param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/l5VsNjtZXKE?hl=en&amp;hd=1"><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/l5VsNjtZXKE?hl=en&amp;hd=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="448" height="252"></object></div>  </div>  <div style="width: 448px; clear: both; font-size: 0.8em;">Time lapse of lowering the suspension, in reverse</div>  </div>  <p>The problem with the video is that I did the time lapse in reverse! I mistakenly sorted the photos in descending order instead of ascending. You really can&rsquo;t tell on the time lapse though, it just looks like another time lapse!</p>

<p>So what did I do today? Well I dropped the car a bit. I wasn&rsquo;t too happy with how little the car dropped after the work this week, so today I spent some time adjusting the suspension a bit. I&rsquo;ve never worked with coil overs or spring perches before so it took a little bit of figuring things out.</p>

<p>I ended up bringing the car down a bit. Here is the photo from yesterday</p>

<p>and what it looks like today (with the race tires on).</p>

<p>I drove around the neighborhood a bit with the race tires on to see if I had any trouble rubbing, in the current configuration it doesn&rsquo;t look to. The wheels are 18x10 +38 Enkei RPF1s, and the tires are 305 V710s, I&rsquo;m glad there doesn&rsquo;t appear to be any rubbing issues, we&rsquo;ll see how it goes under autocross competition though.</p>

<p>After doing all the work I had to take the tires over to Charlie&rsquo;s place to put in the back of Ed&rsquo;s truck. Thankfully Ed is going to haul the wheels/tires down to San Diego for the National Tour next weekend, and the El Toro the following weekend.</p>

<p>I still didn&rsquo;t get a chance to do the alignment on the car, I&rsquo;m hoping to get it to an alignment shop over lunch Monday or Tuesday. I just want them to check the Toe on the alignment for now, I also want to see what the other specs came out as. I may try to do some adjustments in San Diego on Friday/Saturday, but we&rsquo;ll see.</p>
