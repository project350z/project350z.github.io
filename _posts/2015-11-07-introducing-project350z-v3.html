A 2003 Nissan 350z Touring model, with 145k miles on the clock. The car was purchased from a fellow autocrosser, and is primarily prepped for SCCA&rsquo;s STU class.</p>  <p>The car has a couple of issues, the first one I need to address is that the horn doesn&rsquo;t work. After digging into it, I found it is because it simply isn&rsquo;t wired up, a previous owner had replaced the stock wheel, and when the owner I purchased it from got it, he put the original stock wheel back on. The wiring was jacked at this point, and the cruise control and horn no longer connect/work. I&rsquo;ve already placed an order for some parts to hopefully get those two items addressed this coming week so I can get it out for Missouri inspection so I can get it tagged.</p>  <p>I&rsquo;ll be doing some modifications over the winter to get it in line with the STU rules, and hopefully fully prepped to give it a competitive chance for 2016.&nbsp;</p>  <p>This Sunday (11/8) I'll have the car out and running at the final <a href="http://www.gatewayautox.com">Gateway Autocross Association</a> event for 2015, see you out there!</p>  <p>Stay tuned as I dig into the car and get to actively blogging more as I get the work done on the car.</p>
