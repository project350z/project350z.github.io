<p>Have you ever wanted to learn how to tune the suspension on a car?</p>

<p>Well, I haven’t really wanted to know that, until recently. Now I NEED to know. I took the Evo Advantage program this past weekend at the San Diego National Tour and felt like a total newb when the instructor kept telling me to do things to the car and I had no idea what he was talking about.</p>

<p>So now the question is, how best to learn the art of suspension tuning? Well, I started off on Amazon and picked up <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0879380713/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=chrishammondc-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0879380713">Tune to Win: The art and science of race car development and tuning</a><img style="border-bottom-style: none !important; border-right-style: none !important; margin: 0px; border-top-style: none !important; border-left-style: none !important" border="0" alt="" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0879380713" width="1" height="1" /> by Carroll Smith.</p>

<p>I’ve yet to crack it open, but I plan to start on it this evening. I’ll post more on the website later when I have a feeling for what it actually provides, and can talk about what I am learning (hopefully I’ll learn something!)</p>
