<p>I took all of this stuff out of my car a few months ago and am just now getting around to selling.</p>

<p>To the best of my knowledge here is what I have, you can find all the pictures from below (and more) at a higher resolution at <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/sets/72157626520108688/with/5628927973/">http://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/sets/72157626520108688/with/5628927973/</a></p>

<p>All equipment is used, but was in working order when removed from the car.</p>

<p>Package Price    <br /><b>$950 cash</b> </p>

<p><strong>Amplifiers</strong>     <br />JL Audio 300/4     <br />JL Audio 500/1 </p>

<p><strong>Speakers      <br /></strong>JL Audio VR650CXi (pair)     <br />JL Audio VR650CWi (pair) (best I can find online is CSi? but my pic is clearly CWi) Tweeters are not removed from car, so not included. </p>

<p><strong>Subwoofer</strong>     <br />JL Audio Stealthbox </p>

<p><strong>Head Unit      <br /></strong>Pioneer deh-p860mp (also including the wiring/adapter for aux input, remote)</p>

<p>Looking to sell as a package deal for $950/cash, local pickup only. Located in San Carlos CA.    <br />Everything is in working order as far as I know, worked fine when I removed it from the car.     <br /><strong>Photos      <br /></strong><img border="0" alt="" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5310/5629476064_d7f491783e.jpg" />     <br /><img border="0" alt="" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5101/5629477564_3011a9a1bb.jpg" />     <br /><img border="0" alt="" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5185/5629481608_0831b3432b.jpg" />     <br /><img border="0" alt="" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5022/5629491412_49f098e033.jpg" />     <br /><img border="0" alt="" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5266/5629499594_4476951bbd.jpg" />     <br /><img border="0" alt="" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5222/5628920001_ff51902a1f.jpg" />     <br /><img border="0" alt="" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5147/5629503768_7fe2ae0cb6.jpg" />     <br /><img border="0" alt="" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5304/5628924297_9f09a1ec95.jpg" />     <br /><img border="0" alt="" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5149/5629506200_779834a0a4.jpg" />     <br /><img border="0" alt="" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5309/5628927973_b20f29dac8.jpg" />     <br /><img border="0" alt="" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5027/5628932103_115563482f.jpg" /></p>
