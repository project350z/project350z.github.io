<p>So today was a busy day, I had a lot to catch up on at work, training to provide internally, and a final to take this afternoon. After that I ran home and grabbed the set of Falken Azenis RT-615s that were sitting in the garage and ran to Les Schwab (<a href="http://www.project350z.com/Articles/itemId/486/Race-tire-mounting-in-the-San-Francisco-Bay-Area-.aspx">the same place I bitched about a few weeks ago</a>) to get them mounted.</p>

<p>They weren’t too thrilled about what I had to offer them, but they did get them mounted (took a while though). A 265 35 18 on an 18x8” wheel is not idea according to them, but they did it nonetheless and I appreciate it. Why the rush to get street tires mounted? It’s been raining here for what seems like weeks and with the divisional being tomorrow morning I wanted to be prepared. I am taking the V710s, but I figured having a new set of street tires would be a good idea if I decided there was too much water for the V710s. I also figured the set that was on there was a little old and bald, not exactly safe in the rain.</p>

<p>So tomorrow morning begins another autocross, a two day divisional at Great America in Santa Clara. I went down to register tonight but they had closed up the registration due to all the rain coming down, so I at least found out my work assignment (3rd heat announce) and spent some time driving with my wife and baby.</p>

<p>I’ll have video up tomorrow night of the event, we’ll see how things go. I’m hoping it dries a little so that the V710s can have some fun.</p>
