<p>This blog post will be gradually updated over time as I figure out how to drop weight in the 350z prepping it for <s>STR in 2010</s> BSP for 2011.</p>

<p>My 2003 350Z weighed in at 3075lbs in race trim, which included the 17&rdquo; Enkei RPF1s, as little fuel as possible, and all the loose items in the rear of the car removed (carpet, spare tire, tools). I also had the stock exhaust removed, and a NISMO Y-Pipe. The car was a 2003 Enthusiast with only front airbags, aluminum door sills, and splash guards. My new car is a 2004 Enthusiast, with aluminum door sills, no splash guards, front airbags only, and a few other custom mods I will document later. I have a feeling it weighs quite a bit more than my 03 did, but I&rsquo;m hoping to get it down under 3k pounds if possible.</p>

<p>Things I will be looking at:</p>  <ul>      <li>Replacing seats</li>      <li><a target="_blank" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/17726343@N00/4309834337/">Removing the custom sub woofers/amps</a>&nbsp;(<a href="http://www.project350z.com/Articles/itemId/492/The-350z-goes-on-a-Diet.aspx">removal post</a>)</li>      <li>Lighter wheels</li>      <li>Lighter battery</li>      <li>Lightweight flywheel</li>      <li>Suspension mods</li>      <li>More to come</li>  </ul>
