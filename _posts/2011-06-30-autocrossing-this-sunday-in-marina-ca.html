<p>Alright, it’s time to get back into the swing of things. The 2011 TireRack SCCA Solo Nationals are in two months, I need to try to get as much seat time as I can between now and then!</p>  <p>This weekend the <a href="http://www.americanauto-x.com/" target="_blank">AmericanAuto-x</a> Series is going on at Marina. I’ve yet to hit an AAS event, so I am looking forward to it. It will have been nearly three months since my last event, so I’m sure I’ll be plenty rusty. I am only going to hit the Sunday event, not ready to do both Saturday and Sunday, as I have some work to do on the car, and also some work to do around the house on Saturday.</p>  <p>If you’re going to be at Marina this weekend, be sure to come up and say hello.</p>
