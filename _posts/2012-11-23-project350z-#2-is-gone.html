<p>Well, the car was in my hands for almost three years (2 months shy), that is longer than I've owned any car since the first Project350z left my hands in September 2006.</p>

<p>One day perhaps I will own another 350z, it isn't in the plans right now, but never say never I suppose.</p>  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/8212015143/" title="the last car photo of #project350z by chrishammond, on Flickr" style="font: inherit;"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8349/8212015143_91b72d00ac.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="the last car photo of #project350z" style="font: inherit;" /></a>
