<p>Today was the first event in the San Francisco Region&rsquo;s slush series. I decided to head out and try to dust some of the rust off, and last night decided to build a camera mount for the car. After seeing the <a href="http://www.tkqlhce.com/click-5311515-10456937?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fstyle%2FCJ%2F794062%3Fpartner%3Daff_cj%26mr%3AtrackingCode%3D5DECBDAC-FA10-DF11-BAE3-0019B9C043EB%26mr%3AreferralID%3DNA&amp;cjsku=794062" target="_blank">GoPro</a> HD Hero2 launch video, I decided it was time to try to start getting more interesting video.</p>

<p>Earlier this week I attempted to do something interesting with video on my bicycle for <a href="http://www.bicycletips.com">www.bicycletips.com</a> but the video turned out pretty bad.</p>

<p>For the 350z I wanted to try to get the camera up and behind the car. Not just on top of the car, but a couple feet back and above the car. So I got the building, really I didn&rsquo;t build much, just assembled some parts that I had, and that I picked up from the local Ace Hardware store here in Half Moon Bay.</p>

<p>This is the end result</p>

<p>I won&rsquo;t bother posting all the parts of what this contains, not yet, as it is just V1, and you will see from the video below that it actually doesn&rsquo;t work that well.</p>

<p>[YouTube:StTNNow9F74]</p>

<p>That is video of my 4th run today. I had cone issues all day long, and the fourth run was no exception, but that&rsquo;s not the real focus of this post, the video.</p>

<p>The video, blah, it really didn&rsquo;t turn out well. The camera has two major flaws. One the way I mounted it into the extension wasn&rsquo;t secure enough, so it had slight movement, which I think is the majority of the noise you hear, though some of that could actually be from the safety strap that I had all this tied to the car with.</p>

<p>The other flaw was the amount of movement on the camera/poll itself. I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s a good way to get rid of that without doing some sort of guide cable setup, which I hope to try out in the next couple of weeks.</p>

<p>I do like the angle that the view that the video shows, makes for an interesting angle for sure.</p>

<p>What do you think? Besides the shakyness and the bad audio, what do you think of the setup?</p>
