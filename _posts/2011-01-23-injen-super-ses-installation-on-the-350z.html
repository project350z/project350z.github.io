<p>If you followed the <a href="http://www.project350z.com/Articles/itemId/488/Injen-Customer-Service-Update-It-rocks.aspx">blog post earlier this week</a> you already know that Injen came through and got me the replacement midpipes for my Super SES Exhaust which I removed late last year.</p>

<p>Today I took the OEM exhaust off the 350z and put the Injen exhaust back on. The job itself is easy, probably could do it all in about 25 minutes if I really pushed it, but I didn&rsquo;t. I took my time, cleaned up in the garage a bit, cleaned up the exhaust a bit as well. I also managed to weigh both the Injen exhaust and the OEM exhaust to see what the difference was. I was hoping it would be more!</p>  <table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2" width="613">      <tbody>          <tr>              <td valign="top" style="width: 225px;"><strong>Exhaust</strong></td>              <td valign="top" style="width: 386px;"><strong>Weight</strong></td>          </tr>          <tr>              <td valign="top" style="width: 225px;">OEM 350z Exhaust</td>              <td valign="top" style="width: 386px;">Y-pipe (15lbs) Midpipe (10lbs) Muffler (35lbs)         <br />              <strong>Total 60lbs</strong></td>          </tr>          <tr>              <td valign="top" style="width: 225px;">Injen Super SES Exhaust</td>              <td valign="top" style="width: 386px;">Midpipes (10lbs each) Muffler (15lbs each)         <br />              <strong>Total 50lbs</strong></td>          </tr>      </tbody>  </table>  <p><em>(these weights were taken on a standard bathroom scale, not sure of their accuracy)</em></p>

<p>So installing the Super SES Exhaust should save me ~10lbs over the stock setup, providing more flow and hopefully more horse power. I had the car dyno&rsquo;d back in April of 2010 with the original Super SES setup on it, I will have to find the dyno sheets but if I recall correctly it was around 259 to the rear wheels. Not bad considering I believe my first Z in stock form on a totally different dyno setup, did around 219 to the rear.</p>

<p>I setup my GoPro HD today to take a photo every 2 seconds while I was working, I think it turned out well, though a number of the shots are a little dark in the garage, I think I can fix that next time.</p>

<p>I also took a number of photos of the exhaust before putting it on.</p>
