<p>No, the suspension didn&rsquo;t break, but man did murphy show up in full force today.</p>  <p>I&rsquo;ll do a full write up with photos and what to do, where, etc, later this week, but for now let&rsquo;s talk about what went wrong!</p>  <p>The rear of the car was great, only a couple of minor issues. The first issue was that one of the rear shocks didn&rsquo;t have the nut that came with the original Konis so that the upper mount could attach. Not a huge deal as I had a spare nut to use. Then when I went to put it on the car I found out that I was missing two other nuts, for the lower mount/bolt. I didn&rsquo;t have anything for those so I had to run to Ace Hardware to pick something up. I also got some anti-seize because I remember how much of a pain the lower bolt was on my old 350z, so much that I left the shocks on it when I sold it because I couldn&rsquo;t get them off.</p>  <p>Not a huge deal like I said, I got the rear squared away.</p>  <p><a title="Rear Suspension Complete" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/17726343@N00/5545390097/"><img alt="Rear Suspension Complete" src="http://static.flickr.com/5134/5545390097_6d382db3da.jpg" style="border-width: 0px;border-style: solid;" /></a></p>  <p>The fronts however were a different story. Everything came off easily, even the oem control arms. I quickly realized that I wasn&rsquo;t going to be able to get the bushings out though, I was going to need to have them pressed out. Not a huge deal, I could put the other control arms on, the SPL arms that I got with all the suspension. I wasn&rsquo;t planning on using the SPL arms, because they aren&rsquo;t legal for the class I am running in Autocross, but I could put them on for a few days while I finished up the OEM arms and custom bushings.</p>  <p>I did try to burn the bushings out, and while I caused a mess and got some nice burning rubber fumes floating around the garage, I didn&rsquo;t get very far. Here&rsquo;s a photo of the before and after</p>  <p>Before    <br />  <a title="OEM UCA Bushings" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/17726343@N00/5545397739/"><img alt="OEM UCA Bushings" src="http://static.flickr.com/5095/5545397739_64459e05c7.jpg" style="border-width: 0px;border-style: solid;" /></a></p>  <p>After    <br />  <a title="What's left the the OEM Bushing" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/17726343@N00/5545402039/"><img alt="What's left the the OEM Bushing" src="http://static.flickr.com/5257/5545402039_c84c4f8115.jpg" style="border-width: 0px;border-style: solid;" /></a></p>  <p>So I started to put things together, the front coilovers back on, and I started to bolt them in place. Problem. The TrueChoice Koni coilovers unfortunately don&rsquo;t use the same bolt as the stock struts did. And guess what? I didn&rsquo;t have anything that would work. I ended up driving around town for 2 hours this afternoon trying to find a bolt that would work. I found something, but it was class 8.8, which from my reading is equivalent to grade 5. Most likely not strong enough, but I went ahead and tried to use them anyways.</p>  <p>Then, next thing. I put this bolt in place, and then started to attach the upper control arm back in place. That&rsquo;s when I ran into the next problem. The SPL arm&rsquo;s ball joint uses a different size bolt than the OEM ball joints, so here I am again, without the parts needed to put the car back together. I ended up getting the car rollable so I could get it entirely into the garage, then put it back up on jack stands in the front, then removed the other oem control arm. I&rsquo;m going to have Natalie take me to work tomorrow, and hopefully I can get the control arm bushings pressed out so that I can get the car back together tomorrow or Tuesday evening. I also need to order new bolts for the front struts. (m12 1.75 70mm should work)</p>  <p>I have a lot of photos from today posted on the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/sets/72157626235414092/with/5545402039/" target="_blank">Suspension Flickr Set</a>.</p>  <p>And of course, here&rsquo;s the time lapse!</p>  <div style="padding-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; float: none; padding-top: 0px;" id="scid:5737277B-5D6D-4f48-ABFC-DD9C333F4C5D:045669ef-f2a4-4802-afcb-ccea57261883" class="wlWriterEditableSmartContent">  <div id="fb88b8ff-eb0f-4869-9644-5f54ba209a0d" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline;">  <div><object width="448" height="252">  <param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/gpE_jgeJwMA?hl=en&amp;hd=1"><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/gpE_jgeJwMA?hl=en&amp;hd=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="448" height="252"></object></div>  </div>  <div style="width: 448px; clear: both; font-size: 0.8em;">Time lapse of the suspension work</div>  </div>
