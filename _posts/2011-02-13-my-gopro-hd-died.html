<p>So I ran into a few issues today with my GoPro HD. I was working on the car, and was going to do another time lapse, even picked up a second battery last night so that I was sure I would get as much as possible.</p>

<p>Then my GoPro HD crapped out on me. It turns out there’s a Time Lapse bug that when it takes the 9999 photo (in the camera’s life) it freaks out and starts creating tons of folders, and stops taking photos. So I tried updating the firmware to fix the bug, but somehow managed to totally hose the GoPro HD all together. Now it won’t turn on.</p>

<p>Here’s the video I did get today.</p>  <div style="padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; float: none; padding-top: 0px" id="scid:5737277B-5D6D-4f48-ABFC-DD9C333F4C5D:f3ace3e1-37c3-456e-86ae-6f13a7143cbf" class="wlWriterEditableSmartContent"><div id="2e9399bb-6f31-41c9-b45c-d2b196997456" style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; display: inline;"><div><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1R0bxm03rA&amp;feature=youtube_gdata_player" target="_new"><img src="/assets/images/PublishThumbnails/Windows-Live-Writer/87fd497cae94_13048/videof60072728bed.jpg" style="border-style: none" galleryimg="no" onload="var downlevelDiv = document.getElementById('2e9399bb-6f31-41c9-b45c-d2b196997456'); downlevelDiv.innerHTML = &quot;&lt;div&gt;&lt;object width=\&quot;448\&quot; height=\&quot;252\&quot;&gt;&lt;param name=\&quot;movie\&quot; value=\&quot;http://www.youtube.com/v/b1R0bxm03rA?hl=en&amp;hd=1\&quot;&gt;&lt;\/param&gt;&lt;embed src=\&quot;http://www.youtube.com/v/b1R0bxm03rA?hl=en&amp;hd=1\&quot; type=\&quot;application/x-shockwave-flash\&quot; width=\&quot;448\&quot; height=\&quot;252\&quot;&gt;&lt;\/embed&gt;&lt;\/object&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;&quot;;" alt=""></a></div></div><div style="width:448px;clear:both;font-size:.8em">Short video before the GoPro HD Died</div></div>    <p>I did get a lot done on the car today. I replaced all the OEM studs with longer ARP studs, as well as I managed to get both the front and rear Hotchkis sway bars installed.</p>

<p>It looks like I won’t have any HD Video of tomorrows Autocross, but I will take my older GoPro (non-hd) to see if I can get some, along with my ChaseCam. The car is loaded up and ready to go, tires are stuffed inside!</p>
