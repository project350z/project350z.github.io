<p>I was looking around at Flickr today and happened to check out my &quot;photo stats&quot;. The most viewed photo for the day (having just started according to the Flickr servers) was this photo</p>
<p> <a href="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2660/4116932158_8e616e230c.jpg" rel="lightbox"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2660/4116932158_8e616e230c_m.jpg" width="240" height="160" alt="350z with the white stripe"></a> </p>
<p>I kind of liked the white stripe on my old 350z. Iâ€™m still thinking I will wrap this one, but the stripe got me reminiscing.</p>
<p>What do you think of the stripe? Yay or nay? Add a comment below and let me know!</p>
<p>You can find a number of photos of the car during the striping process at <a href="http://www.project350z.com/Photos/view/setdisplay/setid/72157622833814994.aspx">350z White Stripe</a></p>
