										So this weekend while my beautiful wife was in town (haven’t
										seen her for three weeks!) I rented a car for the weekend?
										Why? Well, to be honest, the 350z wasn’t legal to be driving
										around on the roads of California! The temporary tags
										expired on the 1st, and I had planned to hit the DMV up on
										the 2nd, only to figure out that California had state
										employees on furlough so the DMV is closed the first three
										Fridays in April. Welcome to California!
									</p>

									<p>
										So I rented a car for the weekend, a Mid-sized from National
										(via Hotwire) and we picked out a black New Beetle. It
										wasn’t a half bad ride for the weekend, the windshield felt
										like it was 10 miles away, and I would hate to try to sit in
										the back seat, but for the two of us it worked out fine.
									</p>

									<p>
										Over the weekend I tried to figure out what I was going to
										do with the 350z, I need to get some OEM Cats (catalytic
										converters) to put back on the car as it came with non-oem
										ones when I purchased it from the dealer in Colorado. (quick
										tip: if you buy a car in Colorado, you have three days to
										have a smog test, if it fails you can take it back to the
										dealer, I learned this far too late)
									</p>

									<p>
										I found a few options for getting some OEM Cats and even
										found a shop locally that will put them on for me saving me
										the hassle of doing it myself. Normally this wouldn’t be a
										big deal, but as we haven’t moved all of our stuff from
										Colorado yet I don’t exactly have a jack and stands to get
										under the car to do the swap myself.
									</p>

									<p>
										I’m hoping that cats are all I need to get the car to pass
										emissions, having purchased the car previously modded
										(Stevinson Lexus of Frederick in Colorado so far has been
										unresponsive in my inquiries about why they would sell a car
										that wouldn’t pass smog), I don’t know exactly what has been
										done to the car beyond what I can see. We will see if Cats
										make it legal for California or not. If not I’m likely going
										to be up a creek!
									</p>

									<p>
										Monday morning I headed off to the DMV, arriving there at
										7:10am, with 5 other cars already in the parking lot. Around
										7:25am we started lining up out front to wait for the doors
										to open at 8am. I was third in line. About 15 minutes or so
										before 8am an employee from the DMV came out and handed out
										Window numbers for the first people in line, telling you
										which window to go directly to when the doors opened up. You
										know there’s way too much F’n demand and not enough supply
										when a DMV office has to do this. I wasn’t in there too
										long, it was actually very painless for me. When I left
										though the line was backed up out there door, had to be at
										least 75 people waiting to get in, not to mention all the
										people already in side and waiting.
									</p>

									<p>
										I was able to get a two month temp tag from the state for
										the 350z, so now I’m somewhat legal to drive around as I
										work to get the car to pass smog. Hopefully I can get that
										done here in the next couple of weeks.
									</p>

									<p>
										Sunday I’m going to the
										<a href="http://www.zcargarage.com/" target="_blank"
											>Z Car Garage</a
										>
										for a ZONC (Z cars of Northern California) dyno day. I’m
										curious to see what numbers the car puts down in it’s
										current form and then want to get it dyno’d again after
										swapping the Cats to see if there’s a big difference. I’ll
										take plenty of pictures down there, I’m looking forward to
										meeting some other Z guys this weekend.
